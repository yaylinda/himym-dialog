1,1,"Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch.",13,Lily
1,1,What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.,30,Ted

Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.",103,Ted

1,2,"So you're not goanna call her? You went from, &quot;I think I'm in love with you&quot; to &quot;I'm not gonna call her?&quot;",22,Marshall
1,2,"I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin. (Finds Lily and Robin chatting at a table.) Robin!",36,Ted
1,2,Hey!,1,Robin

1,2,What?,1,Lily
1,2,I'm in love with her.,5,Ted
1,2,No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.,16,Barney
1,2,I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.,14,Ted
1,2,"Lily, you squeaked?",3,Ted
1,2,"She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.",12,Ted

1,2,Comes on a little strong.,5,Robin
1,2,But...that's part of my charm.,5,Ted
1,2,But that's part of his charm.,6,Lily
1,2,"Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?",39,Robin
1,2,Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.,6,Lily
1,2,Oops...,1,Lily
1,2,"She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the &quot;happily ever after&quot; thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.",46,Ted
1,2,So're you gonna ask her out?,6,Marshall
1,2,"Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out?",27,Ted

1,2,"Yeah, cuz nothing says &quot;Casual&quot; like inviting a hundred people over just to &quot;Mac&quot; on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.",22,Barney
1,2,You waited five minutes to tell me that?,8,Lily
1,2,Alright-so call her up!,4,Marshall
1,2,No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a &quot;chance&quot; encounter.,22,Ted
1,2,"that's great, Ted. You'll be the most &quot;Casual&quot; stalker ever.",10,Lily
1,2,"Now ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger, Lily had been...well... extra affectionate.",15,Narrator
1,2,"Baby, no. I have a twenty-five paged paper on unconstitutional law due on Monday, I barely started,",17,Marshall
1,2,"Hey, I'm just sitting here. Wearing my ring... my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or... my underwear. Oh-that's right-I'm not wearing any.",38,Lily
1,2,No underwear?,2,Marshall
1,2,Not slightly.,2,Lily

1,2,"Okay, I got it all planned out.",7,Ted
1,2,"She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, &quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; She says, &quot;Hey, nice place&quot; etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, &quot;Well make yourself at home,&quot; and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, &quot;Oh, you're still here?&quot; I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, &quot;Wanna see the roof?&quot;",99,Ted
1,2,The roof.,2,Lily and Marshall
1,2,Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.,14,Ted
1,2,What's so special about the roof?,6,Barney

1,2,Thank you.,2,Fantasy Girl
1,2,"Yeah, but she's not Robin.",5,Ted
1,2,"Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?",41,Barney
1,2,"Barney, I don't wanna say-",5,Ted

I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up. (Ted's shocked) I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin?  Hi! Hi Robin. (Throws book on the floor and grabs Lily for s*x)",83,Marshall
1,2,so you threw all these parties for me?,8,Robin
1,2,"No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I--one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh- this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it -Anyway Robin, this is.",53,Ted
1,2,Carlos,1,Carlos
1,2,Ohhh.,1,Barney and Ted
1,2,"She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over.",13,Ted

1,2,I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.,10,Ted
1,2,It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.,11,Robin
1,2,"No, I'm not.",3,Ted
1,2,"Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.",48,Robin
1,2,Click. Off. Let's make out.,5,Ted
1,2,What?,1,Robin
1,2,"What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof.",32,Ted

1,2,"look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but... we could.",13,Robin
1,2,"I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, &quot;Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass.&quot;",26,Ted
1,2,You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand.,30,Robin

1,4,"Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone.",20,Lily
1,4,"Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person.  It's the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling?",46,Marshall

1,4,Why? What is so horrible about that?,7,Lily

1,4,"It's going against the internet now! It's okay, grow up.",10,Ted

1,6,Do you like Mike?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,Of course I do. Why?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume.,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,Are you trying to get me to join a cult?,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,How about you start by sharing dessert.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Barney. What, you're back?",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,That's right.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,In a totally new costume.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,What's with the face?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,So go to the bathroom.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there.",14,<strong>Angel Guy</strong>
1,6,"Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?",7,<strong>Angel Guy</strong>
1,6,"A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours.,16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,Take the damn picture. (<em>squawks)</em>,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,Got it.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time.,26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"Thanks, Marshmallow.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,You wouldn't believe.,3,<strong>Hula Girl</strong>
1,6,I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink.,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,You certainly are a charming devil.,6,<strong>Hula Girl</strong>
1,6,I'm also a horny devil.  Yeah.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,No.,1,<strong>Hula Girl</strong>
1,6,"Oh, go to hell.",4,<strong>Barney</strong> <em>(to Angel Guy)</em>
1,6,"You know, if you guys like tiramisu we found this little Italian place...",13,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,"No, you found it. I came with you. Go on.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,I'm just saying we love tiramisu.,6,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,I cannot get enough of it.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,We're crazy for this stuff.,5,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,We love tiramisu. Am I wrong in saying that.?,9,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,"No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,So this Italian place? How's their cannoli?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"See there, hungry.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.",6,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,"Hey, is that Gary Oldman?",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Wait, where?",2,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,I don't see...,3,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,Brain freeze.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,OK Victoria's Secret party right now.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,Nope.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,She might.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,Oy.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,<em></em> See ya.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"No, see ya. <em>(evil laughs, sparks something in his hands</em>) Ow.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,Wanna drink the melty part?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna take off.",12,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,"Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.",11,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,I like being with you.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.",23,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,"Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Actually, it kinda does.",4,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,"Wait, are we breaking up?",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,We aren't breaking up. I'm breaking up with you.,9,<strong>Mike</strong>
1,6,And then just when I was about to lose hope.,10,<strong>Future Ted VO</strong>
1,6,She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Kahlua, root beer, could this penguin be the Slutty Pumpkin?",10,<strong>Future Ted VO</strong>
1,6,"Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...",42,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,Unbelievable.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Yes, it is.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.,8,<strong>Hula Girl</strong>
1,6,"What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,I cannot believe I gave you my number,8,<strong>Hula Girl</strong>
1,6,"Yeah, well, you did, thanks.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"Well, give it back.",4,<strong>Hula girl</strong>
1,6,"Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,But I'm never gonna go out with you.,8,<strong>Hula Girl</strong>
1,6,But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,Nice.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,I'm staying.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,Fine. Fine.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,What are you doing?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,I'm flippering you off.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,6,"Sweetie, I'm so sorry.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.",28,<strong>Carl</strong>
1,6,Oh yeah!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,Wait. What did he say?,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"Gay pirate, where are you getting that from?",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"Dude, you're wearing eye liner.",5,<strong>Carl</strong>
1,6,"OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have s*x with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won!",34,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"I love you, Marshmallow.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,6,"I love you too, Lilypad.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,6,"You guys, let me get a picture.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,I had a feeling I'd find you here.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,I never played any team sports,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.,26,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Man, that sucks.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?",48,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.",17,Ted
1,6,But you're wired just fine.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?",30,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.,27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,Really?,1,Robin
1,6,"Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin.  pumpkin-pumpkin...",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,6,"How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.",29,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,6,"Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2",29,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,7,It's a cockamouse.,3,Lily
1,7,What?,1,Robin

1,7,Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?,6,Barney
1,7,That's impossible. That simply can't happen.,6,Robin
1,7,"Oh, but it can.",4,Lily

1,7,"Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out",9,Barney

1,7,"Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.",21,Ellen
1,7,You said it was gonna be three days.,8,Ted
1,7,Did I?,2,Ellen
1,7,Hm.,1,Ted
1,7,Three days? Really?,3,Ellen
1,7,"Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",21,Ted
1,7,"How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.",28,Ellen
1,7,There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.,15,Ted
1,7,I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.,13,Ellen
1,7,"But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",13,Ted
1,7,How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.,26,Ellen
1,7,"Well, I'm not.",3,Ted
1,7,A little bi maybe?,4,Ellen
1,7,"No. You're messing with me, right?",6,Ted
1,7,Come see for yourself.,4,Ellen
1,7,"I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...",20,Ellen
1,7,There's a 9.6 right there.,5,Ted
1,7,"Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.",22,Ellen
1,7,What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?,15,Ted
1,7,8.5.,1,Ellen
1,7,So he sucks.,3,Ted
1,7,"No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.",8,Ellen
1,7,"Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",9,Ted
1,7,"Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.",36,Ellen
1,7,He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.,7,Lily
1,7,And it's the size of a potato.,7,Marshall
1,7,"So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",6,Robin
1,7,Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.,8,Marshall
1,7,"My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",14,Ted
1,7,"Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",8,Barney
1,7,And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.,7,Marshall
1,7,Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.,8,Lily
1,7,"For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",17,Marshall
1,7,"Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",22,Robin
1,7,So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?,8,Marshall
1,7,"Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",24,Robin
1,7,"If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",22,Marshall
1,7,"It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",15,Marshall
1,7,"OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",25,Ted
1,7,You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.,12,Barney
1,7,"All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?",42,Ted
1,7,"That's right, I did the math.",6,Future Ted VO
1,7,Hi.,1,Ted
1,7,"Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.",4,Sarah
1,7,I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.,12,Ted
1,7,"Hi, I'm Ted.",3,Ted
1,7,"So, what are we doing today?",6,Sarah
1,7,I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.,17,Ted
1,7,I'm exactly the same.,4,Sarah
1,7,"Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.",13,Ted (singing)
1,7,Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.,7,Sarah (joining in singing)
1,7,"Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",10,Ted
1,7,"Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",16,Ted
1,7,I love brunch.,3,Sarah
1,7,"It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",17,Ted
1,7,"I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.",8,Sarah
1,7,"Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",30,Ted
1,7,"Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.",11,Sarah
1,7,Friday night?,2,Ted
1,7,"Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",5,Ted
1,7,Thank you.,2,Sarah
1,7,I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?,26,Ted
1,7,Only a little.,3,Sarah
1,7,"Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",25,Ted
1,7,"OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.",12,Sarah
1,7,I'm sure you do.,4,Ted
1,7,"Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",15,Robin
1,7,"OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",14,Lily
1,7,"Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",17,Marshall

1,7,The doctor will see you now.,6,Barney
1,7,"What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",11,Ted
1,7,Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.,12,Lily
1,7,"Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",37,Ted
1,7,Happy ending.,2,Barney
1,7,"Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.",25,Ted
1,7,"All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",7,Barney
1,7,"Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",15,Lily
1,7,"Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",7,Barney
1,7,Oh my God!,3,Marshall
1,7,Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?,11,Lily
1,7,"Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",29,Marshall
1,7,"Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat?",22,Lily
1,7,Hello again.,2,Ted
1,7,I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.,15,Sarah
1,7,"Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",8,Ted
1,7,You have a basal cell carcinoma.,6,Sarah
1,7,Anything else?,2,Ted
1,7,"Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.",17,Sarah
1,7,"Wait, then you're still getting married.",6,Ted
1,7,Of course I'm still getting married.,6,Sarah
1,7,But we're a 9.6.,4,Ted
1,7,Excuse me.,2,Sarah
1,7,"OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.",26,Ted
1,7,You looked at my file.,5,Sarah
1,7,I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fianc√© thinks we're a better match.,27,Ted

1,7,"Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",19,Ted
1,7,Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?,18,Sarah
1,7,"See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",9,Ted
1,7,"Ted, just calm down.",4,Sarah
1,7,Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.,21,Ted
1,7,"Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.",24,Sarah
1,7,"Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",9,Ted
1,7,"Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.",21,Sarah

1,7,What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?,11,Lily
1,7,It was the only think I could think of.,9,Robin
1,7,Lily thank God.,3,Marshall

1,7,It can fly.,3,Robin
1,7,Wow.,1,Marshall
1,7,"Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.",23,Marshall
1,7,Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.,9,Ted
1,7,"I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.",65,Ellen
1,7,"Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit clich√©?",15,Ted
1,7,It's for the bourbon.,4,Ellen
1,7,This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.,9,Ted
1,7,"No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.",7,Ellen
1,7,"I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.",23,Ted
1,7,"No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.",19,Ellen
1,7,You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.,14,Ted
1,7,No you won't.,3,Ellen
1,7,Yes I will,3,Ted
1,7,How do you know? Ted,5,Ellen
1,7,You're losing me.,3,Ellen
1,7,"Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.",21,Ted
1,7,So I should keep looking?,5,Ellen
1,7,Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.,12,Ted

1,8,What? What are you talking about?,6,Ted
1,8,And why is that girl checking you out?,8,Robin
1,8,"Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",22,Barney

1,8,Sort of on a date with her.,7,Barney
1,8,What?,1,Ted
1,8,"I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",54,Barney
1,8,All right.,2,Ted
1,8,You're going to the hospital?,5,Robin
1,8,"No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",29,Ted
1,8,"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",19,Robin

1,8,"So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",7,Robin
1,8,"He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",18,Ted
1,8,"Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",18,Robin
1,8,I should really make this call.,6,Ted
1,8,"Ooh, can I do it?",5,Robin
1,8,Hello? Robin,2,Barney
1,8,"Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",5,Barney

1,8,What happened to Shocky?,4,Ted
1,8,What's this? Lily,3,Ted
1,8,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",7,Ted
1,8,Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,9,Marshall
1,8,"Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",19,Ted
1,8,"Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",8,Marshall
1,8,"No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",12,Ted
1,8,You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,11,Marshall
1,8,That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,8,Ted
1,8,They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,16,Ted
1,8,"Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",8,Barney
1,8,"Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",11,Robin
1,8,It's not just the coffeemaker.,5,Ted
1,8,Done. The painting's done.,4,Lily
1,8,That is great.,3,Marshall
1,8,Nice.,1,Ted
1,8,Where do you wanna hang it?,6,Marshall
1,8,"I don't know. Um, over the piano?",7,Lily
1,8,"Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",20,Ted
1,8,"Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",10,Marshall
1,8,"I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",12,Ted
1,8,OK.,1,Lily
1,8,He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,11,Ted
1,8,"Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",12,Robin
1,8,"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",15,Robin
1,8,"Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",21,Barney
1,8,"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",8,Ted
1,8,"You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",17,Barney
1,8,"What, like buy a new sofa?",6,Ted
1,8,Bigger.,1,Barney
1,8,"Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",20,Barney
1,8,"A lemon law, like for cars.",6,Robin
1,8,"Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",53,Barney
1,8,Hi Katie. Barney.,3,Barney
1,8,"Hi, it's good to finally meet you.",7,Katie
1,8,"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",12,Barney
1,8,Tell your friends.,3,Barney (yelling to Katie as she leaves)
1,8,It's gonna be a thing.,5,Barney (to Robin and Ted at other table)
1,8,"Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved &quot;Ted&quot; into that block of cheese.",20,Lily
1,8,"Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",5,Marshall
1,8,He's not cool with me moving in.,7,Lily
1,8,"No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",15,Marshall
1,8,"So, what's he PMS'ing about?",5,Lily
1,8,I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.,21,Marshall
1,8,Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.,9,Lily
1,8,He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.,15,Lily
1,8,You clearly don't know Ted.,5,Marshall
1,8,Delivery for Ted Mosby.,4,Delivery guy
1,8,Your English phone booth arrived.,5,Marshall
1,8,"Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",5,Ted
1,8,"Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",11,Marshall
1,8,"Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",15,Ted
1,8,"Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",20,Marshall
1,8,Exactly.,1,Ted
1,8,Great,1,Marshall
1,8,Terrific.,1,Marshall
1,8,You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.,21,Marshall
1,8,"Oh, so it's like that, is it?",7,Ted
1,8,"Bring, bring.",2,Marshall
1,8,"Oh hello governor, oh it's like isn't it? Cheerio.",9,Marshall (in British accent)
1,8,"Yeah, it's like that.",4,Marshall
1,8,I want this apartment.,4,Ted
1,8,"Well, I want it too.",5,Marshall
1,8,You're a jerk.,3,Girl #2
1,8,"No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",11,Barney
1,8,"For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",19,Robin
1,8,"No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",6,Barney
1,8,"It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",27,Robin
1,8,"OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",13,Barney
1,8,You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?,18,Barney
1,8,"Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",11,Robin
1,8,"Bad move, Scherbatsky.",3,Barney
1,8,"Hi, have you met Robin?",5,Barney
1,8,Hi.,1,Kevin
1,8,Hi.,1,Robin
1,8,"All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.",21,Ted
1,8,Or we could flip a coin.,6,Marshall
1,8,"Yeah, let's flip a coin.",5,Ted
1,8,Flip it.,2,Marshall
1,8,"OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.",7,Ted
1,8,Flip it.,2,Marshall
1,8,"OK, here I go.",4,Ted
1,8,Flip it.,2,Marshall
1,8,"I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",32,Ted
1,8,That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?,20,Marshall
1,8,"OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",6,Ted
1,8,You don't need two rooms,5,Marshall
1,8,"Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",9,Ted
1,8,We might be starting a family soon.,7,Marshall
1,8,"Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.",23,Ted
1,8,"It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",13,Marshall
1,8,"Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",14,Ted
1,8,"Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.",19,Marshall
1,8,"Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",10,Ted
1,8,We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?,21,Ted
1,8,"My fianc√©...suddenly, she's my fianc√©.",5,Marshall
1,8,"Lily's a part of who I am. And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension.",26,(Marshall picks up other sword) Marshall
1,8,"I deserve this apartment, Marshall.",5,Ted
1,8,No more than I do.,5,Marshall
1,8,"Great, so let's flip for it.",6,Ted
1,8,Flip it.,2,Marshall
1,8,"So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?",10,Ted
1,8,I guess so.,3,Marshall
1,8,How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?,12,Ted
1,8,We should probably figure that out.,6,Marshall
1,8,"It's OK, it's OK.",4,Ted
1,8,Can I observe something?,4,Ted
1,8,That this is kinda awesome?,5,Marshall
1,8,Totally.,1,Ted
1,8,I can't believe we didn't do this before.,8,Marshall
1,8,I know!,2,Ted
1,8,Thank you.,2,Robin
1,8,I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.,20,Kevin
1,8,It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.,12,Robin
1,8,In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders.,25,Kevin
1,8,Just a second.,3,Robin
1,8,Hello.,1,Robin
1,8,"Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.",10,Barney
1,8,Leave me alone.,3,Robin
1,8,4,1,Barney
1,8,We're only just getting to know each other.,8,Robin
1,8,Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.,17,Barney
1,8,Sorry.,1,Robin
1,8,"Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.",13,Kevin
1,8,"No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.",14,Robin
1,8,"Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money.",12,Kevin
1,8,That was awesome.,3,Marshall
1,8,I know.,2,Ted
1,8,Do it again.,3,Marshall
1,8,"OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",11,Ted
1,8,"Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",43,Ted
1,8,"Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",2,Marshall
1,8,What?,1,Ted
1,8,"Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",41,Marshall
1,8,Anhedonic?,1,Ted
1,8,Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,7,Marshall
1,8,The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.,7,Ted
1,8,"I know, this rules.",4,Marshall
1,8,"Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",8,Marshall
1,8,"That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",12,Ted
1,8,Yeah it did.,3,Marshall
1,8,You remember when we first got these swords?,8,Marshall
1,8,It was the day we moved in.,7,Ted
1,8,"Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.",12,Ted
1,8,"List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table",19,Marshall
1,8,"Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.",7,Ted
1,8,Yeah.,1,Marshall
1,8,"Oh God, I'll be right there.",6,Robin
1,8,"Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.",15,Robin
1,8,"Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront.",20,Kevin
1,8,"No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.",12,Robin
1,8,I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fianc√©.,7,Marshall
1,8,"Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fianc√©? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall",23,Ted
1,8,"I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",32,Ted
1,8,Is she OK?,3,Robin
1,8,They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.,9,Marshall
1,8,"So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.",12,Barney
1,8,"What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.",15,Barney
1,8,"Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.",22,Barney
1,8,"Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.",10,Jackie
1,8,"It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.",20,Barney
1,8,But you're totally...,3,Robin
1,8,Just let him have this one.,6,Ted
1,8,All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table?,16,Doctor
1,8,That's us.,2,Marshall
1,8,A sword fight?,3,Lily
1,8,"Sorry, Lily.",2,Ted
1,8,"On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fianc√© ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.",29,Lily
1,8,"Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",12,Marshall
1,8,"I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",14,Lily
1,8,You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.,16,Marshall
1,8,"Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.",9,Ted
1,8,"Uh, you know, if I tried...",6,Marshall
1,8,"Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",46,Lily
1,8,Gonna miss the old place.,5,Marshall
1,8,I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.,11,Lily
1,8,"Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.",11,Ted
1,8,Totally.,1,Marshall
1,8,Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving.,10,Lily
1,8,Let's go get some dinner.,5,Marshall
1,8,I know just the place.,5,Lily
1,8,"Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.",7,Ted
1,8,"I told you. OK, a toast.",6,Lily
1,8,"Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.",29,Lily
1,8,Here here. Cheers,3,Everyone
1,8,And to the lemon law.,5,Barney
1,8,Self-clink.,1,Barney
1,8,"And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses.",17,Lily
1,8,I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.,10,Marshall
1,8,I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year.,14,Lily
1,8,"Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.",8,Robin
1,8,"I love you, Lily. Happy Valentine's Day 1998.",8,Marshall (on tape)

1,9,"Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time. It's a time for giving of yourself, for thinking of your fellow man, a time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder.",31,Future Ted VO
1,9,"Well, I just ralphed.",4,Lily
1,9,How much did you guys drink last night?,8,Robin
1,9,Not how much? What.,4,Ted
1,9,"The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.",25,Barney
1,9,It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.,6,Marshall
1,9,"You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan.",9,Ted
1,9,The shuttle's here!,3,Marshall
1,9,He hasn't been back home to Minnesota since Christmas. He's a little excited.,13,Lily
1,9,"Baby, we're holding up the shuttle, do you have everything you need? Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants. Underpants.",16,Marshall
1,9,"So, Lil, Marshall's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited?",12,Ted
1,9,"Yeah, no, it'll be fun.",5,Lily
1,9,"Lily, you just said, &quot;yeah, no.&quot;",6,Robin

1,9,"Yeah, no, shut up.",4,Lily
1,9,"Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving.",8,Robin
1,9,"No, I have to work on Friday. You?",8,Ted
1,9,"I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.",8,Robin
1,9,"Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, &quot;oat&quot;",14,Ted
1,9,"You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.",25,Robin
1,9,Your cops are called Mounties.,5,Ted
1,9,"So, probably hanging out with Barney then?",7,Robin
1,9,"No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.",7,Ted
1,9,"Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal.",39,Barney
1,9,"Oh, Barney.",2,Lily
1,9,"I'm sorry, Native American.",4,Barney
1,9,"I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food.",11,Ted
1,9,That's awesome.,2,Robin
1,9,"Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.",15,Ted
1,9,Canceling out Barney.,3,Barney
1,9,Exactly.,1,Ted
1,9,Where are all my underpants?,5,Marshall
1,9,Did you check your suitcase?,5,Lily
1,9,Let's go.,2,Marshall

1,9,"Hello, we're home!",3,Marshall
1,9,"A very big welcome. You see, at 6'4&quot;, Marshall was the runt of the Ericksen clan.",16,Future Ted VO
1,9,"Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.",8,Lily
1,9,Where's my almost daughter-in-law?,4,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,Here I am.,3,Lily
1,9,"You got yourself a great little bride here, son.",9,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,"All right now, no farting around. Put your skates and your pads on, boys. Game on in five minutes.",19,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,You're gonna go play hockey?,5,Lily
1,9,With a basketball?,3,Lily
1,9,"Well, it's a combination of the two. We call it baskiceball.",11,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world.,13,Marshall
1,9,Baskiceball? Not iceketball?,3,Lily
1,9,Iceketball? Just sounds weird.,4,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,Yeah.,1,Ericksens
1,9,"It's baskiceball, OK? And I'm the best.",7,Marcus
1,9,You wish.,2,Marshall
1,9,"Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play.",11,Lily
1,9,"I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl.",12,Marshall
1,9,"Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl.",10,Lily
1,9,Marcus!,1,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,This is gonna be great.,5,Robin
1,9,"I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.",33,Ted
1,9,"Excuse me, guys. Coming through.",5,Barney
1,9,Barney?,1,Ted
1,9,"Well, hi guys.",3,Barney
1,9,What are you doing here?,5,Ted
1,9,"Oh, just the Lord's work.",5,Barney
1,9,But you're Satan.,3,Ted
1,9,"Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.",28,Barney
1,9,"This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here.",10,Robin
1,9,"Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?",21,Kendall
1,9,I'm on it.,3,Barney
1,9,"Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?",8,Ted
1,9,"Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer",9,Kendall
1,9,"That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.",9,Barney
1,9,"Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?",15,Ted
1,9,"Go home, we're full.",4,Kendall
1,9,What? Ted,2,Robin
1,9,"On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can.",11,Kendall
1,9,"Come on, we just wanna help out.",7,Robin
1,9,"Kendall, they're cool.",3,Barney
1,9,"Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.",16,Kendall
1,9,"OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.",20,Barney
1,9,"Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's early but you are a future Mrs. Ericksen.",15,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it.,10,Lily
1,9,"OK, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty.",8,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,"Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette.",14,Lily
1,9,But this is an American holiday.,6,Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,"Now that you're going to be a Mrs. Ericksen, I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe. The Ericksen family seven-layer salad.",24,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,Seven-layer salad?,2,Lily
1,9,Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right.,8,Lily
1,9,"Oh no, dear, sixteen cups.",5,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,Mayo's in that cabinet.,4,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,"Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it.",49,Marshall
1,9,"Yeah, you were sitting pretty until I whacked you with that mallet.",12,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,(to Mrs. Ericksen) Hey Gorgeous!,5,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,You having fun? Lily,4,Marshall
1,9,"Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime.",7,Marshall
1,9,"Oh, halftime's over. Get yours butts out here, come on.",10,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,"And I hope you like the taste of stick, dorko.",10,Marvin
1,9,Go.,1,Lily
1,9,Thanks baby.,2,Marshall
1,9,"Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town?",17,Marshall
1,9,"Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!",6,Marshall
1,9,"Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.",17,Barney
1,9,Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot.,21,Robin
1,9,"Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?",19,Ted
1,9,"You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.",17,Barney
1,9,"OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next?",12,Lily
1,9,Potato chips.,2,Lily
1,9,"So, Lily, when are you gonna start thinking about having a baby?",12,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,"Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all.",12,Lily
1,9,"Actually Aunt Lily was lying. It'd been all she'd been thinking about. You see, remember when she said...",18,Future Ted VO
1,9,"Well, I just ralphed.",4,Lily
1,9,At that point she was five days late. This was day six.,12,Future Ted VO
1,9,"Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?",12,Lily
1,9,"Oh, are you kidding? I was younger than you when I had Marcus. Beautiful 15 pound boy. Not much bigger than this turkey right here.",25,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,Oh my.,2,Lily
1,9,"Now if Lily was already uneasy about joining the Ericksen family, imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Ericksen growing inside of her.",25,Future Ted VO
1,9,"That's a big baby, Judy.",5,Lily
1,9,The doctor thought he was twins.,6,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,Twins. Twins!,2,Lily
1,9,This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work?,13,Ted
1,9,I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend.,16,Robin
1,9,Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway?,11,Ted
1,9,I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at.,15,Robin
1,9,"What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl...",10,Ted
1,9,Have you met Ted?,4,Robin
1,9,"Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is...",8,Ted
1,9,... gone.,2,Ted
1,9,I'm Amanda.,2,Amanda
1,9,Hi.,1,Ted
1,9,"So, what do you do here, Ted?",7,Amanda
1,9,"Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing.",6,Ted
1,9,"If you want to do something, you and your girlfriend can help sort through these donations.",16,Amanda
1,9,"Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God.",25,Robin
1,9,"So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?",9,Ted
1,9,"OK, this is important. Go through all these boxes of food donations, take out the really good stuff and put it into this box.",24,Amanda
1,9,Got it. Consider it sorted.,5,Ted
1,9,"Hey, we're in business.",4,Robin
1,9,"Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.",9,Ted
1,9,Let's start with this one.,5,Ted
1,9,Yeah.,1,Robin
1,9,Amen.,1,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,Amen.,1,Ericksens
1,9,Look who came to say good-night. It's little Martin. Three-months old.,11,Pregnant Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,Three months! Three months?,4,Lily
1,9,He's been drinking his milk.,5,Marshall
1,9,Here here.,2,Ericksens
1,9,And she's already pregnant again.,5,Lily
1,9,"Well, that's 'cause those Ericksen boy's boys can swim. They've got two tails and a drill bit for a head.",20,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,"Dad, you're embarrassing me.",4,Marshall
1,9,"Ah, son, she's cool. She's gonna be an Ericksen.",9,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,"Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name.",12,Lily
1,9,But the apron.,3,Mrs. Ericksen
1,9,"Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so...",8,Marshall
1,9,"No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name.",9,Lily
1,9,But Ericksen is a great last name. People know the Ericksen's.,11,Mr. Ericksen
1,9,"Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby?",18,Lily
1,9,"Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.",22,Marshall
1,9,"Oh, so is New York.",5,Lily
1,9,What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.,20,Lily
1,9,"Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?",6,Ted
1,9,"Oh, that's for me. You can put it in my car.",11,Amanda
1,9,"In your car, um, then you'll take it...",8,Ted
1,9,"Home? We get so much extra food, no one can eat it all. Oh, Truffle oil. Score.",17,Amanda
1,9,People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry.,12,Ted
1,9,"I know, and I'm starving.",5,Amanda
1,9,"But, Marshall, you love New York.",6,Lily
1,9,"Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.",19,Marshall
1,9,"Yeah, to Brooklyn.",3,Lily
1,9,Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road.,13,Marshall
1,9,But Lily knew way down the road might not be so far down the road.,15,Future Ted VO
1,9,I need to go to the restroom.,7,Lily
1,9,"Lily, the restroom's the other way.",6,Marshall
1,9,So she headed down the road.,6,Future Ted VO
1,9,Lily.,1,Marshall
1,9,Lily!,1,Marshall
1,9,"So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.",30,Barney
1,9,"Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?",10,Kendall
1,9,"Yeah, Right. Thanks.",3,Barney
1,9,Barney.,1,Ted
1,9,"Yeah, what's up?",3,Barney
1,9,You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.,12,Ted
1,9,"Yeah, so.",2,Barney
1,9,"All right, let me see that.",6,Ted
1,9,That's my private personal business!,5,Barney
1,9,Court-mandated community service.,3,Ted
1,9,That's my private personal business.,5,Barney
1,9,I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.,12,Barney
1,9,You peed on a church?,5,Ted
1,9,I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.,20,Barney
1,9,"Oh, you are evil.",4,Ted
1,9,"Now, all's right with the world again.",7,Robin
1,9,"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.",21,Barney
1,9,When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?,11,Barney
1,9,"Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people.",11,Ted
1,9,Amanda! I called dibs on the Portobello mushrooms.,8,Kendall
1,9,Those are for the hungry.,5,Ted
1,9,"I know, and I'm starving.",5,Kendall
1,9,Those are good mushrooms!,4,Amanda
1,9,Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!,13,Ted
1,9,Happy Thanksgiving.,2,Clerk
1,9,"Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me.",60,Lily
1,9,You know the Ericksen's? Marshall's fianc√©.,6,Clerk
1,9,Fantastic.,1,Lily
1,9,So nice to meet you. You are taller than described.,10,Clerk
1,9,I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom?,14,Lily
1,9,Don't have one.,3,Clerk
1,9,So what do you do when you have to...?,9,Lily
1,9,I hold it.,3,Clerk
1,9,You can't fire a volunteer.,5,Ted
1,9,Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,8,Robin
1,9,I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,34,Barney
1,9,Volunteer of the year!,4,Barney
1,9,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.",24,Ted
1,9,"Ted, I'm glad you asked.",5,Barney
1,9,Surprisingly good.,2,Robin
1,9,Right? I told you so.,5,Barney
1,9,Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?,8,Ted
1,9,Lily's been arrested.,3,Marshall
1,9,"Oh dear, what for? Marshall",5,Judy
1,9,"Thanks, Pete.",2,Marshall
1,9,No problemo Marsh.,3,Pete
1,9,You all right? Lily,4,Marshall
1,9,"Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?",26,Marshall
1,9,"OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise.",21,Lily
1,9,"Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just...",11,Marshall
1,9,Just promise.,2,Lily
1,9,Why do you want me to promise you that?,9,Marshall
1,9,Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.,27,Lily
1,9,"I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?",42,Marshall
1,9,"OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test.",11,Pete
1,9,Pete arrested me before I could look at it.,9,Lily
1,9,Whoa.,1,Marshall
1,9,Yeah.,1,Lily
1,9,"Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous.",12,Marshall
1,9,"Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall",10,Lily
1,9,"Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.",26,Marshall
1,9,"We'll be our own family, and we'll find our own way to freak out the people our kids bring home.",20,(Lily shakes her head) Marshall
1,9,"Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.",38,Lily

1,10,"Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy",7,Ted
1,10,"Here, let me.",3,(Ted gets his phone out) Trudy

1,10,"Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.",14,Robin
1,10,I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.,13,Ted

1,11,"Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks. Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve. I had an idea of how to do it, too. And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.",64,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,11,"Yeah, that's right...a limo.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,"Oh, man, Ted, this is great.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,11,"Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.",40,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,Question?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,11,"Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,"But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,11,Yeah.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,11,"We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,"All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?",14,<strong>Lily</strong>

1,11,"Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,"People often ask me &quot;Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?&quot;",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,11,By who? Who asks you that?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,11,"And the answer is right here... my own, personal &quot;get psyched&quot; mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",47,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,11,It's working.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,11,I am definitely getting psyched.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,11,Let's do this!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>

1,11,"Well, this kind of sucks.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,11,"Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.",28,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,11,Party number one!,3,<strong>Ranjit</strong>

1,11,Isn't she awesome?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,11,"How are your feet doing, baby?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,11,"Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?",22,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,11,"Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,11,Maybe I should just go home.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,11,My finger slipped.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,11,"Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight.",42,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,11,Mary Beth.,2,<strong>Mary Beth</strong>
1,11,You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?,15,<strong>Robin</strong>

1,12,"When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist.",67,Future Ted VO
1,12,Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?,10,Ted
1,12,"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted",8,Barney
1,12,"You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.",25,Barney
1,12,"Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?",9,Ted
1,12,"Ted, it's a simile.",4,Barney
1,12,"Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?",25,Ted
1,12,Of course I knew who I wanted to bring,9,Future Ted VO
1,12,"The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.",18,Future Ted VO
1,12,"Pft, Derek.",2,Future Ted VO
1,12,"Well, Derek and I just broke up.",7,Robin
1,12,"No, that's terrible, are you OK?",6,Lily
1,12,"Yeah, do you need a drink or something?",8,Marshall
1,12,"Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",11,Robin
1,12,"Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",32,Barney
1,12,"Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",12,Robin
1,12,"OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.",15,Ted
1,12,"Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave.",9,Lily
1,12,"Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.",24,Marshall
1,12,"No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.",12,Ted
1,12,Robin was into me when we first met. Fact.,9,Ted
1,12,"Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.",16,Ted
1,12,"On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.",8,Ted
1,12,I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,10,Ted
1,12,"What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.",19,Barney
1,12,"This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.",14,Marshall
1,12,"Ah, here we go.",4,Lily
1,12,What?,1,Barney
1,12,We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.,22,Lily
1,12,"Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.",12,Marshall
1,12,I thought so.,3,Lily
1,12,"You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.",33,Marshall
1,12,A little girl?,3,Lily
1,12,What up?,2,Barney
1,12,"OK, I'm just saying, that it's my wedding too and I should have a say in it.",17,(Barney and Lily high-five) Marshall
1,12,"Yes, but I'm the bride so I win.",8,Lily
1,12,"Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.",13,Marshall
1,12,"Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.",8,Lily
1,12,"Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.",36,Barney
1,12,"You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.",22,Ted
1,12,"Well, makes sense.",3,Robin
1,12,"So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?",23,Ted
1,12,"Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted",10,Robin
1,12,"Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?",13,Robin
1,12,"Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.",8,Ted
1,12,"Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.",20,Robin
1,12,"Lily, I need a dress.",5,Robin
1,12,"You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?",13,Lily
1,12,"I know, it's a suicide mission.",6,Robin
1,12,"Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.",15,Lily
1,12,Bye babe.,2,Marshall
1,12,"Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney",31,Ted
1,12,"Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?",6,Ted
1,12,"Invigorating, thanks.",2,Barney
1,12,"OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked.",22,Future Ted VO
1,12,You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting. The stars line up and shazam.,18,Future Ted VO
1,12,I know now that life is never that simple.,9,Future Ted VO
1,12,"Hey, Claudia!",2,Ted
1,12,"Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye.",53,Claudia
1,12,"Hey, how's it going? Claudia",5,Ted
1,12,"Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.",10,Ted
1,12,"You should be, lots of single girls.",7,Claudia
1,12,"Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.",13,Ted
1,12,What? Ted,2,Claudia
1,12,You're not bringing a date.,5,Claudia
1,12,"Uh, yes I am.",4,Ted
1,12,"Uh, no you're not.",4,Claudia
1,12,I checked 'plus one'.,4,Ted
1,12,No you didn't.,3,Claudia
1,12,"Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...",6,Ted
1,12,"Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding.",16,Claudia
1,12,But I already invited someone.,5,Ted
1,12,"You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months!",16,Claudia
1,12,But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.,10,Ted
1,12,"You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it?",57,Claudia
1,12,"She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.",10,Ted
1,12,"What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes?",21,Claudia
1,12,"Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?",15,Ted
1,12,Don't make me hurt you Ted.,6,Claudia
1,12,"I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.",7,Ted
1,12,"But to be fair, she's also hot.",7,Barney
1,12,"I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.",9,Ted
1,12,"Yeah, right.",2,Barney
1,12,I did.,2,Ted
1,12,"Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?",54,Barney
1,12,"Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.",8,Ted
1,12,"Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...",13,Barney
1,12,A little Barney.,3,Marshall
1,12,"A little Barney. And you know what he said?  &quot;Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.&quot;",27,Barney
1,12,Wow.,1,Marshall
1,12,Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...,12,Ted
1,12,"Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.",16,Marshall
1,12,Then what am I gonna do?,6,Ted
1,12,The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come.,11,Marshall
1,12,Just a second.,3,Robin
1,12,Hey.,1,Lily
1,12,"Hey, listen.",2,Ted
1,12,"Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.",37,Lily
1,12,Lily's there's a problem.,4,Ted
1,12,"Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress.",11,Lily
1,12,Go.,1,Lily
1,12,"Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?",10,Robin
1,12,I think I brought it.,5,Robin
1,12,Wow.,1,Ted
1,12,That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.,17,Robin
1,12,"Yeah, about that.",3,Ted
1,12,I'll pick you up at five.,6,(Robin looks at Ted) Ted
1,12,"So, the dress?",3,Lily
1,12,I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.,9,Ted
1,12,What?,1,Lily
1,12,I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,17,Ted
1,12,Why didn't you check 'plus...,5,Lily
1,12,I did check 'plus one'.,5,Ted
1,12,But Robin is so excited.,5,Lily
1,12,I know.,2,Ted
1,12,And the dress.,3,Lily
1,12,I know.,2,Ted
1,12,"Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.",8,Lily
1,12,"We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.",8,Ted
1,12,I wish we were ninjas.,5,Lily
1,12,I know.,2,Ted
1,12,You can always ask Stuart.,5,Lily
1,12,Can I do that?,4,Ted
1,12,"Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.",16,Lily
1,12,"Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.",7,Ted
1,12,"Dude, no problem whatsoever.",4,Stuart
1,12,Really? Stuart,2,Ted
1,12,"Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...",14,Ted
1,12,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.",28,Stuart
1,12,"Yeah, she's not usually like that.",6,Ted
1,12,No.,1,Stuart
1,12,"Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.",9,Ted
1,12,"Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.",18,Lily
1,12,"Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.",19,Marshall
1,12,"Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.",5,Lily
1,12,Like you could possibly know that.,6,Marshall
1,12,I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.,12,Ted
1,12,Nice.,1,Lily
1,12,What? How?,2,Marshall
1,12,I talked to Stuart.,4,Ted
1,12,"Oh, you went around the bride. &quot;Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight.&quot; Did you known about this?",35,Marshall
1,12,It may have been my idea.,6,Lily
1,12,What? Stuart doesn't get a say.,6,Lily
1,12,"Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.",12,Marshall
1,12,"Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.",10,Lily
1,12,So I can invite whoever I want.,7,Marshall
1,12,"Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.",8,Lily
1,12,It's Claudia.,2,Ted
1,12,"So, it begins.",3,Marshall
1,12,"Come on, it can't be that bad.",7,Ted
1,12,"Here, Lily, you answer it.",5,Ted
1,12,What? Why?,2,Lily
1,12,Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.,11,Ted
1,12,But...but you're the guy...oh.,4,Lily
1,12,"Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?",6,Lily
1,12,"Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this.",13,Future Ted VO
1,12,"Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding.",20,Stuart
1,12,You what?,2,Claudia
1,12,I told him he could bring a date to the wedding.,11,Stuart
1,12,Always undermining me at every turn.,6,Claudia
1,12,"Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you.",12,Stuart
1,12,"And your mother, calling me all the time...",8,Claudia
1,12,"You know what, the wedding's off.",6,Stuart
1,12,They broke up.,3,Lily
1,12,Ow!,1,Ted
1,12,"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",2,Lily
1,12,"It's not because of me, is it?",7,Ted
1,12,Uh-huh.,1,Lily
1,12,"My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill Ted, then I'm gonna kill Ted.",21,Claudia
1,12,It's Robin.,2,Ted
1,12,Answer it.,2,Lily
1,12,"Uh, Lily's phone.",3,Ted
1,12,Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.,15,Robin
1,12,"Uh, Lily's busy.",3,Ted
1,12,"Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.",15,Robin
1,12,"That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.",30,Ted
1,12,Bye-bye.,1,Robin
1,12,"Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?",18,Ted
1,12,"Ted, focus.",2,Marshall
1,12,"Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?",11,Lily
1,12,I wanna go somewhere and drink.,6,Claudia
1,12,"OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.",9,Lily
1,12,I feel terrible.,3,Ted
1,12,"Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.",33,Marshall
1,12,Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?,10,Ted
1,12,"She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.",12,Lily
1,12,Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,9,Ted
1,12,"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia",7,Barney
1,12,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.",12,Barney
1,12,You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.,6,Claudia
1,12,"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",10,Barney
1,12,They all drink vodka cranberries.,5,Barney
1,12,"So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",8,Barney
1,12,"You got $400,000?",3,Claudia
1,12,"No, but I do have a hug.",7,Barney
1,12,"(looking up, whispers) Thank you.",5,Barney
1,12,"Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...",14,Ted
1,12,"Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me.",15,Stuart
1,12,"Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.",8,Marshall
1,12,"Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning p0rn.",30,Stuart
1,12,"Dude, who doesn't.",3,Marshall
1,12,"You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, &quot;why am I with Claudia? I can be with her.&quot;",21,Stuart
1,12,"That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...",10,Ted
1,12,"The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.",29,Stuart
1,12,"Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.",15,Ted
1,12,"How would you know, you're not even married?",8,Stuart
1,12,"OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.",20,Ted
1,12,"Stuart, don't get married.",4,Marshall
1,12,Dude.,1,Ted
1,12,What?,1,Stuart
1,12,"I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.",59,Marshall
1,12,"You know I don't have $400,000, right?",7,Ted
1,12,"Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man.",25,(Barney and Claudia sit next to each other in booth) Claudia
1,12,"That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.",8,Barney
1,12,"Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.",6,Barney
1,12,"Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.",10,Claudia
1,12,"Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.",30,Barney
1,12,"Oh, hell no.",3,Lily
1,12,Oww,1,Barney
1,12,"Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",56,Lily
1,12,"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily",7,Barney
1,12,"All right, all right.",4,Barney
1,12,Claudia.,1,Stuart
1,12,Stuart. I'm so sorry.,4,Claudia
1,12,I'm so sorry too.,4,Stuart
1,12,I love you.,3,Claudia
1,12,"I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize...",24,Stuart
1,12,Marshall said what?,3,Claudia
1,12,He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together.,15,Stuart
1,12,"So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?",11,Ted
1,12,It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia but eventually she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.,19,Ted runs away) Future Ted VO
1,12,Still wow.,2,Ted
1,12,Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.,7,Robin
1,12,"Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.",38,Ted
1,12,Sorry.,1,Robin
1,12,"Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin",8,Robin
1,12,"Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.",20,Robin
1,12,Do it. Do it.,4,Ted
1,12,"OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...",16,Robin
1,12,"So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing.",10,Marshall
1,12,I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.,11,Lily
1,12,Crab puffs were incredible.,4,Marshall
1,12,We should totally have them at our wedding.,8,Lily
1,12,"Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.",7,Marshall
1,12,Did we just start planning our wedding?,7,Lily
1,12,I think we did.,4,Marshall
1,12,We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.,9,Lily
1,12,"Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.",9,Marshall
1,12,"My God, were you born without taste buds?",8,Lily
1,12,What?,1,Lily
1,12,I love you.,3,Marshall
1,12,"Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",17,Robin
1,12,"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.",24,Barney
1,12,What's a sixteen?,3,Ted
1,12,Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,7,Barney
1,12,Hi Ted.,2,Claudia
1,12,Claudia.,1,Ted
1,12,We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.,15,Claudia
1,12,"Yeah, where is she?",4,Stuart
1,12,Um  She couldn't make it.,5,Ted
1,12,What's so funny? Claudia,4,Ted
1,12,"Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.",34,Ted
1,12,"Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.",6,Barney
1,12,"By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.",9,Claudia
1,12,I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney,9,Ted
1,12,I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,16,Ted
1,12,Being single's the best.,4,Barney
1,12,Stay out as late as you want.,7,Ted
1,12,Answer to no one.,4,Barney
1,12,The whole world full of endless possibilities.,7,Ted
1,12,Never having to go to a farmer's market.,8,Barney
1,12,"OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",39,Barney
1,12,"So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong.",50,Future Ted VO

1,13,Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break.,17,Future Ted VO
1,13,"And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it...",13,Future Ted VO
1,13,"Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?",10,Lily
1,13,I had the most amazing night ever.,7,Ted
1,13,"Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.",41,Marshall
1,13,"Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake...",16,Lily
1,13,Say what?,2,Marshall
1,13,Lily.,1,Ted
1,13,"Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go.",8,Lily
1,13,"I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings.",14,Victoria
1,13,I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.,8,Ted
1,13,"Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real.",17,Victoria
1,13,"Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.",25,Ted
1,13,You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee.,11,Victoria
1,13,Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.,13,Ted
1,13,Wedding goggles.,2,Victoria
1,13,"Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.",15,Ted
1,13,This isn't the moves?,4,Victoria
1,13,"What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.",21,Ted
1,13,That's too bad.,3,Victoria
1,13,Tell me about it.,4,Ted
1,13,"You know, I think I have a solution.",8,Victoria
1,13,Interested.,1,Ted
1,13,"And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight.",11,Victoria
1,13,Less interested.,2,Ted
1,13,Go ahead.,2,Ted
1,13,"OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out.",23,Victoria
1,13,What are you saying?,4,Ted
1,13,"I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again.",33,Victoria
1,13,Unless...,1,Ted
1,13,"No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect.",39,Victoria
1,13,"Wow. OK, I'm in.",4,Ted
1,13,OK.,1,Victoria
1,13,"I guess, what, we'll need fake names?",7,Ted
1,13,"Um, you can call me Buttercup.",6,Victoria
1,13,"Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.",8,Ted
1,13,"Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...",12,Ted
1,13,"Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.",21,Barney
1,13,"So, I'm Ted.",3,Ted
1,13,Victoria. But no last names.,5,Victoria
1,13,No last names.,3,Ted
1,13,Oh.,1,Marshall
1,13,"Oh, what is wrong with you?",6,Lily
1,13,"Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.",9,Marshall
1,13,"No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.",22,Ted
1,13,"Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.",48,Marshall
1,13,"That cake really got to you, huh?",7,Ted
1,13,It haunts me.,3,Marshall
1,13,"So, what happened next?",4,Lily
1,13,"OK, ground rules have been established.",6,(flashback to Ted and Victoria at wedding) Victoria
1,13,Mm-hm.,1,Ted
1,13,Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.,12,Victoria
1,13,Wait wait wait wait wait.,5,Victoria
1,13,Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.,16,Victoria
1,13,"Yes, but we'll need a diversion.",6,Ted
1,13,Kiss.,1,Ted
1,13,"Go. Go, go, go",4,Ted
1,13,"So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.",17,Lily
1,13,You're not gonna do it at your wedding?,8,Ted
1,13,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.",25,Lily
1,13,"So, where did you guys go?",6,Marshall
1,13,Very nice.,2,Ted
1,13,Yeah?,1,Victoria
1,13,"OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance.",8,Victoria
1,13,I couldn't really tell.,4,Ted
1,13,"Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.",10,Ted
1,13,"Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.",9,Victoria
1,13,No you couldn't.,3,Ted
1,13,You're a dude. I could totally...,6,Victoria
1,13,Totally get some.,3,Ted
1,13,We're not gonna kiss tonight.,5,Victoria
1,13,"If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.",25,Victoria
1,13,I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,9,Ted
1,13,"OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.",37,Victoria
1,13,OK.,1,Ted
1,13,But we can't kiss.,4,Victoria
1,13,OK.,1,Ted
1,13,"A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",17,Marshall
1,13,"Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",12,Lily
1,13,"She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",22,Ted
1,13,"Dammit, I have to see her again.",7,Ted
1,13,Yes.,1,Marshall
1,13,"So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",13,Marshall
1,13,"Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",13,Ted
1,13,"Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",14,Lily
1,13,"Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",9,Ted
1,13,"No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",8,Lily
1,13,"Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",9,Marshall
1,13,Ted?,1,Claudia
1,13,"Hey, Claudia, great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff. How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl and I was wondering if you had...",28,(Ted on phone in his apartment) Ted
1,13,"Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.",9,Claudia
1,13,"Oh, here we go.",4,Stuart
1,13,"24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?",22,Claudia
1,13,I've moved on.,3,Ted
1,13,"What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.",17,Claudia
1,13,"Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",12,Ted
1,13,"Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.",12,Claudia
1,13,Thank God.,2,Ted
1,13,"Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.",12,Claudia
1,13,There was no Victoria at the wedding.,7,Ted
1,13,"Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",13,Lily
1,13,"Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",38,Marshall
1,13,Marshall. She was not a ghost.,6,Ted
1,13,"I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",17,Marshall
1,13,"Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",25,Ted
1,13,Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,10,Lily
1,13,"This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",26,Barney
1,13,Barney.,1,Nirvana
1,13,Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,9,Barney
1,13,"Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",20,Ted
1,13,You know I did.,4,Barney
1,13,Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,10,Ted
1,13,You know I won't.,4,Barney
1,13,Why not?,2,Ted
1,13,"Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",38,Barney
1,13,"Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",9,Lily
1,13,"Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",32,Barney
1,13,"OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",22,Ted
1,13,Really? Ted,2,Barney
1,13,But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,15,Barney
1,13,I'm ready to be proven wrong.,6,Ted
1,13,Tonight? Ted,2,Barney
1,13,"Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",36,Barney
1,13,What kind of shoes...,4,Barney
1,13,"Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",15,Barney
1,13,Actually.,1,Ted
1,13,Oh come on.,3,Barney
1,13,Hey.,1,Victoria
1,13,"So, what do you want to do next?",8,Ted
1,13,Uh...,1,Victoria
1,13,Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,8,Ted
1,13,Hold this.,2,Victoria
1,13,Whoa. There she goes.,4,Ted
1,13,Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,11,Barney
1,13,"Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",11,Barney
1,13,I understand.,2,Ted
1,13,"OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",32,Lily
1,13,Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,7,Marshall
1,13,"No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",34,Ted
1,13,Agreed.,1,Marshall
1,13,"And I thought that was the end of it, but then...",11,Future Ted VO
1,13,"Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",8,Lily
1,13,"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",23,Robin
1,13,"Congrats, that's so cool.",4,Lily
1,13,"Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",9,Robin
1,13,"Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",8,Lily
1,13,"And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it...",26,Future Ted VO
1,13,What?,1,Lily
1,13,I know who she is.,5,Robin
1,13,"You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",12,Lily
1,13,"Actually, I kind of was.",5,Robin
1,13,What?,1,Lily
1,13,"Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",18,Robin
1,13,Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,6,Robin
1,13,Hello? You OK in there?,5,Victoria
1,13,"Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",10,Robin
1,13,"Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.",16,Victoria
1,13,"Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",30,Robin
1,13,"Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?",12,Victoria
1,13,Because you have feelings for Ted.,6,Lily
1,13,"I don't know, maybe.",4,Robin
1,13,"OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",29,Lily
1,13,"Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",32,Robin
1,13,Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,25,Lily
1,13,"OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily",9,Robin
1,13,But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,31,Robin
1,13,Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,15,Lily
1,13,I'm gonna go find him.,5,Robin
1,13,"Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",9,Lily
1,13,I have no idea.,4,Robin
1,13,"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for s*x.",38,Barney
1,13,I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,17,Barney
1,13,"Hi, guys,",2,Robin
1,13,Hey.,1,Ted
1,13,"Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",11,Robin
1,13,Sure. What's up?,3,Ted
1,13,"Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",8,Robin
1,13,Oh.,1,Ted
1,13,"Oh, just get it.",4,Robin
1,13,Hello.,1,Ted
1,13,"Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you.",13,Stuart
1,13,Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!,31,Claudia
1,13,Sweet pea.,2,Stuart
1,13,Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.,26,Claudia
1,13,"It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",7,Ted
1,13,"Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",12,Ted
1,13,Cake.,1,Claudia
1,13,Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.,11,Victoria
1,13,"Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",14,Robin
1,13,We got it at this little bakery downtown.,8,Claudia
1,13,"Actually, neither.",2,Victoria
1,13,It's called the Buttercup Bakery.,5,Claudia
1,13,I made the cake.,4,Victoria
1,13,She made the cake.,4,Ted
1,13,Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.,17,Ted
1,13,"She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",21,Marshall
1,13,I'm going down to that bakery.,6,Ted
1,13,"No, no, don't do it.",5,Lily
1,13,"Baby, what are you talking about?!",6,Marshall
1,13,"Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",14,Ted
1,13,"Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin",28,Lily
1,13,Going. Getting.,2,Ted
1,13,"Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",34,Barney
1,13,Yes! No.,2,Ted
1,13,Oh come on!,3,Barney
1,13,Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.,7,Ted
1,13,"Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.",12,Victoria
1,13,"Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",13,Ted
1,13,"Wow, what was I thinking?",5,Victoria
1,13,"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",8,Ted
1,13,"You got me, you are good.",6,Victoria
1,13,"You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",29,Ted
1,13,The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.,15,Victoria
1,13,Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,5,Lily
1,13,"Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",7,Marshall
1,13,"Ted, you still with us?",5,Barney
1,13,Tell me your last name.,5,Ted
1,13,"You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",9,Ted
1,13,What's that?,2,Victoria
1,13,I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory,16,Ted
1,13,"Hey, Ted.",2,Victoria
1,13,Yeah?,1,Ted
1,13,"Close your eyes, and count to five.",7,Victoria
1,13,"One, two, three, four, five.",5,Ted
1,13,"And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",56,Ted
1,13,"The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",10,Barney
1,13,OK.,1,Ted
1,13,Oh thank God.,3,Victoria

1,14,"Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,"Oh, come on.",3,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,The 18th can't get here fast enough.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,"Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!",21,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,"Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.,7,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,75th and Amsterdam.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.,9,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,"Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.,22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,But I don't want to hide out in here.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me.",45,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,You suited up!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Emilio? The woman will have...,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. &quot;The Torpedo.&quot; Or, as the rollers call it, &quot;Piramide.&quot;",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Father issues. Hot.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,What up! Freeze frame high five!,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.,16,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,"No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,"Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,And they're not even high.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,It's actually working.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, try five.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,24,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?",14,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,"Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,18,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,He's just staring into her eyes.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, &quot;Want to do it?&quot; And I say, &quot;Yeah.&quot;",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Want to...,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Looks like they're about to have theirs.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Should we take this to the bedroom?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,Yes!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Yes!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Yes.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,Yes!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Yes!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"No. No, don't answer it!",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,You can answer it. We have all night.,8,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,You're answering it? He's answering it!,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,No! Do her! Do her now!,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Sure. Good luck with that. <em></em> Sorry about that.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,How about a little more wine?,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,I'll get another bottle.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Shh...,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,But I...,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,See you on the other side.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Yeah.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,All right.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,It's all right. We can do this.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Well, we can't.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,What is it?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,I have to pee.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,This is bad.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Yeah.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",34,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,How much longer do you think you can hold it?,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Oh, boy.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,That's a woman.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Let's just focus on your target.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Right.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...,14,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,14,"Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",29,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.,12,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,14,"Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,We'll see about that.,4,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,14,"Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Well, you have farted in front of me.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,You always do.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Hey.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,What happened?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,But why?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Hit!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Ted, I can't wait any longer.",6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,Should we move to the bedroom?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,There's no time for that.,5,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,14,"They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,I know.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"I love you, Marshall.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"I love you, Lily.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (<em>Barney strips down)</em>,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,You invited me up to your apartment to &quot;play Battleship.&quot; Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,No.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,I'm okay. You okay?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,They must have heard that.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",39,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,I checked with Ted.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",49,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Sure. Good luck with that.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,14,Totally gave us his blessing.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Really?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Really.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,You like Ted.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,I didn't say I liked Ted.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,"You're not gonna tell him, are you?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,46,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,A-7.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,Miss.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,14,Of course.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,14,"Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,Not making me feel better.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Well, it certainly was a first.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Marshall, what makes you cry?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,14,"Oh, just grab my boob already.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,14,"Come on, guys, get a room.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,15,"Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker!",24,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,15,You don't have to shout out &quot;poker&quot; when you win.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,I know. It's just fun to say.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, &quot;invent your own game.&quot;",25,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

1,15,"No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the &quot;gammon,&quot; and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>

And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",51,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",79,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,Us? What would we do?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",35,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,Fine.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,Fine.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,Thank you.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,I should go help Robin.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,"Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, &quot;She's great&quot; too many times, didn't I?",35,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,You must really hate the bitch.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you &quot;Marshall out,&quot; and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question &quot;What?&quot;, then... you got to drink. Got it?",41,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,No,1,<strong>All</strong>
1,15,"Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,15,You don't have to answer that.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.",39,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,15,"Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,What?,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,15,"You said what, you got to drink!",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",29,<strong>Lily</strong>

1,15,"Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",10,<strong>Lily</strong>

1,15,"Cool, okay. You know, whenever.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,Of course.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,15,What?!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Drink!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?",21,<strong>Lily</strong>

1,15,"Play the tape, play it, play it!",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't.

1,15,"Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,Come on. Stay!,3,<strong>All</strong>
1,15,"I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,All right.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",61,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,The kids still call him Funny Butt.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right.",41,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"I love your singing, Barney.",5,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"And I love you, Shannon.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.,10,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Hey, nonfat latte to go.",5,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,"Mellow order, bro, mellow order.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!",8,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,"Sorry, I only give high twos.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.,7,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,"Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.",26,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,"I feel sorry for you, man.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Peace out, hombre.",3,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,"Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,She never showed?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,"So, what happened next?",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,You know what? This was a mistake.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Oh, I know just how to decide who.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,You brought the game to the bar?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,I was winning?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,Fine. I'll go next.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Yeah, we all know that one.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.",12,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,15,"Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.",25,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,15,"Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories, but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one. Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.",27,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,15,That is the greatest story ever!,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,Oh my God!,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Wow, wow!",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Barney.,1,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"Sugar Bear, where were you?",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.",9,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,But the Nicaraguans need us!,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me.",25,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"Shannon, there is no...",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.",14,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.",36,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Now we all got to drink.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Oh, my God. What happened next?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"I don't know, guys.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies...",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Lily, no!",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"For the team, Marshall, for the team.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care.",32,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,So we've got the whole place to ourselves.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,I'm thinking floor s*x.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,Sounds reasonable.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,The whole time?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,The... whole... time.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.",28,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.",21,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,But I love you.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.,16,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,I'm just picking up my last paycheck.,7,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Oh, she got the tape.",5,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,You? It was you?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man.",8,<strong>Man</strong>
1,15,"Oh, you poor thing.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,When?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,Sorry.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,You've got to tell us.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...,25,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,"Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, &quot;I love you.&quot; Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",49,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,To one hell of a night!,6,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
1,15,"And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,Yes! Do it!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,To the cab.,3,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
1,15,Hello? Is someone out there?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,You ralphed and ran?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.,16,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,Sorry.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,It's okay.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,15,"Victoria, I know this must be...",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,15,Yeah. It kind of is.,5,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,15,"Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.",30,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Hi.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Barney?,1,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"Hi, Shannon.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,What are you doing here?,5,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",58,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",74,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Nope.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,Yeah.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Nope.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,Yeah.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Oh, Barney!",2,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,Is your phone on?,4,<strong>Shannon</strong>
1,15,"Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,"Ew, gross. Just stop it.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,15,"Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",49,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,15,I think Barney just won game night.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,15,"We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story.",53,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

1,16,"Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,16,My first solo batch.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.",28,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.",15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,16,"Um, are you coloring in your butt?",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,So wear another one.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",42,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks &quot;suit.&quot; Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"No thanks, dude. <em>(Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart)</em> Noon?",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,Noon. See you then.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Hey, girls.",2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin and Lily</strong>
1,16,"Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.",18,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Robin!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Really? Oh.,2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.",35,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Really? That'd be great.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.,7,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.,12,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Wait. Germany, Europe?",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.",23,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"So, this is the Europe Germany?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,What other Germany would it be?,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,The one in Epcot?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Ted.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Sorry. Congratulations.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.,10,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.,15,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"So, that leaves us with...",5,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,I have to leave on Monday.,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Monday, September the...?",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Ted. Do you have any thoughts?,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,It's a date.,3,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,And that's when things got complicated.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,16,"Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Well, good luck, baby.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,You speak Ukrainian?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now.",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,Really? You?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,Yeah.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, &quot;You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face.&quot; Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",125,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",37,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",44,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Are you sure?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,All right. (<em>He calls Victoria)</em>,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Hello.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",7,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. <em></em> She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,Here. Play with this pin cushion.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,God. I'm going to look hot.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",48,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,No way. The Kid does not sell out.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,No. I've made my decision.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",47,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.,12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,16,"All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.",33,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,I want you to stay.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Oh, good luck, baby.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,Bye.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?",11,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,16,Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,21,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,I saw a couple up front that were nice.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.",18,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,At least we get free champagne!,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,And cake.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Mm-hmm.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.",29,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.",22,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.,17,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,I really don't...,3,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Thanks.,1,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,16,Oh!,1,<strong>Victoria and Robin</strong>
1,16,"It's okay, guys, I hate it.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,Just horrible.,2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",110,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.,20,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Hey, random question",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",7,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?,11,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Maybe he's going to buy you one.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?,23,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?,11,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Aw.,1,<strong>Victoria and Robin</strong>
1,16,"Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Ugly, ugly, ugly.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.",29,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Are you okay?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,I'm fine.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",47,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,Somebody say &quot;beautiful princess.&quot;,4,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.",44,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,I know what you mean.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,You do?,2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"See, that's what I'm afraid of.",6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.,14,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"No, you are.",3,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Okay, I am.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,I'm going to stay.,4,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Aw.,1,<strong>Victoria and Robin</strong>
1,16,"Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Wow, you look incredible.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. <em>(She sits on the cake, without noticing it)</em> Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",47,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.",15,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,It was like this when I found it?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,And how will you be paying for this?,8,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,16,Credit card... s.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.",18,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,I want you to stay.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,I have to go to Germany.,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,You're going?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Yes. I have to.,4,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,So that's what you decided?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.",29,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"What is this, opposite day or something?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,No.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,So it is?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.",17,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?",13,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Well, that's just crazy.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.",17,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,You'd have me.,3,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,So... we're breaking up?,4,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,I guess so. I guess so.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,She's leaving tomorrow.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, but she's still in town.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, she... she's still in town.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Awesome air kicks, huh?",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,New pajama bottoms?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,You know it.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Wait, so we're sharing the leg?",6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"No, the leg is a metaphor.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.",31,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Well, what would you want to do?",7,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Like go to the Mets.,5,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,See some monkeys at the zoo?,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Wow! We better get going.,5,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, big day.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Yeah.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things.",23,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,16,"Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,"Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, but only, like, second base.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,Look at us,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,I most certainly did...,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,"Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",41,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,"I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,16,What time is the interview?,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,16,9,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,16,I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.,12,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,I'm going to miss you so much.,7,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"I'm going to miss you, too.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...",15,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,Even if we're not.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Okay.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,"Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,Yes. Yes!,2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,We can beat the odds.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"Odds, schmodds.",2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,16,It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,16,"It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later.",21,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.",70,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,So you want to be an anthropologist?,7,<strong>Dr. Birnholz</strong>
1,17,"Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,What she said next changed his life.,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,"Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't. They'll all be dead by then...",14,<strong>Dr. Birnholz</strong>
1,17,"...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,17,I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,All right. I'm pouring it out.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. &quot;The kid&quot; has become &quot;the man.&quot;,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Well... I mean... they did their best.,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,Here's your sack lunch.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>

1,17,"Oh, no. No, she didn't.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Yeah. Yeah, she did.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Another care package?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.,21,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,How many is that so far?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Three.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,And how many have you sent her?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,17,"Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls.

1,17,Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,17,Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.,9,<strong>Bilson</strong>

1,17,"So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Oh, Teddy boy.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.",30,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"All right, here's what you do",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,That is funny.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,And here's why it was funny.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,"Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.",17,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,"Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"The irony is clear, Ted.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,Hey! How was your first day?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.,16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,They're jerks!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,What makes them jerks?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>

1,17,"What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?",10,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,"For your information, my fiancee did.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?",10,<strong>Blauman</strong>
1,17,No.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,What's that?,2,<strong>Blauman</strong>
1,17,Nothing. Give it.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,&quot;Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad.&quot;,9,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,Give it.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it.&quot;",14,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,"Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable.",30,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,I quit.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,"We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Please.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,"I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,21,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,The package?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",36,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,She'll be happy.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.,15,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,"I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.",9,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,"So, did she get the awesome care package yet?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,Yep. Yesterday.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,Did she love it?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"Ooh, she loved it.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,So what's the problem?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"S</strong>o I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.",38,<strong>Ted
1,17,What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Oh, Teddy boy.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.",30,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,It's pretty clear.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,I have to go to Germany and surprise her.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Marshall, consider the penguins.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,The penguins?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,On the wall.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,&quot;Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold.&quot; This is a motivational poster?,18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",44,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,"Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",46,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,Only when I'm drunk.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Good boy.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,17,"Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>

1,17,I'm psyched!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,"Wow, that was really specific.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,17,So badly.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,17,"All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, &quot;Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs.&quot; So I'm, like, &quot;Snapadoo!&quot; So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.",71,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Eriksen...that was steak sauce!,4,<strong>Blauman</strong>

1,17,"So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, &quot;Listen, I've been thinking,&quot; and then follow it up with something good? It's not like",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.",49,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,I'd wait.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>

1,17,"Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,Why?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?",41,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,Okay.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go.",18,<strong>Blauman</strong>

1,17,Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>

1,17,Steak sauce.,2,<strong>Blauman</strong>
1,17,"Steak sauce, dude.",3,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,"Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes!",39,<strong>Blauman</strong>
1,17,That's my man!,3,<strong>Bilson</strong>
1,17,"I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office.",11,<strong>Blauman</strong>
1,17,"Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.",75,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,"Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,17,Hello.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,Why hasn't she called yet?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,17,"No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,17,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.",47,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,17,Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,17,"I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",48,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,18,We broke up.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,18,You're smiling.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,18,And it begins.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,18,"So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,"Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Wow. Weird.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,"Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,I'll be here.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Hello?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Ted, this is your main man, K.E. I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?",20,<strong>Korean Elvis</strong>
1,18,Sorry about that.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,Was that Korean Elvis?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,"Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,"What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Gonna?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,18,Yes. First thing tomorrow.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,18,I hate how you're always right.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,It's my best and most annoying trait.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,18,Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Can I call you tomorrow?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,"Okay. Good night, Robin.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Good night, Ted.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,"Oh, my God. We're making out.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Right.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,This is crazy.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Right? Right?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Yeah.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Yeah?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,"Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Okay.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Stop doing that.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Whatcha doin'?,2,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,"I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...",42,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.,16,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,It's not ideal.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2",18,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,18,"Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,18,I think he just spat on me.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,18,"Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,"No! No, come on.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,18,Yes!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,"Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the &quot;le&quot;. We still got the &quot;gen.&quot; The &quot;da.&quot; The &quot;ry.&quot;",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,18,"Okay, if we're at the &quot;le,&quot; then I say we follow it up with a &quot;t's go home.&quot;",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,18,"Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,"No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh?",14,<strong>Korean Elvis</strong>
1,18,"Okay, seriously.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,18,"Hey, I know what you like.",6,<strong>Korean Elvis</strong>
1,18,"And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.",25,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,18,"Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,18,You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Good. So you're gonna go home?,6,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,"Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,Ted.,1,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,"It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",54,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Oh, please. You just want to get laid.",8,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,"Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",53,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,That's not your phone.,4,<strong>Victoria</strong>
1,18,This isn't my phone.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,"Okay. Bye. <em></em> I thought it was mine, so I answered it.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,Was it...?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,18,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,18,"I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up. Yes... And there you have it, kids. The stupidest thing I've ever done. In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this",61,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

1,19,What do you mean &quot;could&quot;?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Trust that impulse, Ted.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,A... LAME-A?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",39,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,Yes! Word up!,3,<strong>All</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, put me down for two.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Really? It's three months away.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,31,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Yes, that's what I meant by &quot;you know.&quot; I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,That's only two.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Count again.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,So get an escort.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"By &quot;escort,&quot; you mean prostitute?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Why not?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,Because... gross?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,You really think that's true?,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Yes.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,You just made that up.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Withdrawn.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,57 days.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Is that your water? May I?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, go ahead.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",50,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",40,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.,25,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,I said good day!,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,You okay?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",47,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,Yep.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",28,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"No, it's not going to be weird at all. (<em>Lily's on the phone with Marshall</em>) Robin's bringing a date.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,Boy. That's going to be really weird.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,I know.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,Robin's bringing a date.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Dude, it's going to be weird.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, it won't be weird.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,Thank you.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Because you're going to bring your own date.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Hello, Barney.",2,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,19,"Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,Nice to meet you Ted.,5,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,So we're going to an award show?,7,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,What the hell?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Think about it, this is perfect. A",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.",57,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,500 bucks?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.",29,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.,14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,19,Check out Robin's date.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Is that who I think it is?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,19,These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.,10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,19,"Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p0rn star Sandy...?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yosemite Sandy, definitely.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Excellent choice. I love this guy.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,19,"Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way.,12,<strong>Sandy</strong>

1,19,Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,19,"Well, it's just an internship, for the record.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,A prostitute.,2,<strong>Mary</strong>

1,19,"You got me. What do you do, Ted?",8,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,19,"Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.",46,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.,7,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,19,"Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?",29,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.",24,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,19,Hey.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,We're still friends.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"Oh, so now she's a whore?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,I like that guy.,4,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,19,Hey.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?,9,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,19,"Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.",15,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,19,"Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.,10,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,Sleep with a prostitute?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,You just made that up.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Withdrawn.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.",40,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.,18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, well... there we go.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Scooter &quot;Bam-Bam&quot; Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky.",30,<strong>Vampire Lou</strong>
1,19,"Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.",42,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,Congratulations.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,Sure. Let's go.,3,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Dude, what are you doing?",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,What's it look like?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Oh, that's real mature.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Should we go?,3,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Good night.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"So, did you and Barney ever...?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,There's not enough money in the world.,7,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Oh, thank God.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,I put him in a cab.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,So you and he aren't...?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?,17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,He's off trying to make you jealous.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Mary's a prostitute?,3,waking up
1,19,What?!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,Barney paid for her.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,Is that true?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,19,"You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",29,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,That's her napkin.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,No!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,19,"Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,&quot;Mary's not really a prostitute.&quot;,5,<strong>Vampire Lou</strong>
1,19,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,So she's not...?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",38,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,I feel kind of like Richard Gere.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Not shy about your looks, are you?",7,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Done what?,2,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"You know, been... on a &quot;date.&quot;",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right?",6,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"No. Why, is that so odd?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.",13,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.",12,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,Must be tough.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about a**l. Well, here we are.",20,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,What?,1,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute.",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.",5,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"No, Ted... I'm a paralegal.",5,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,"No, you're a hooker.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"No, I'm a paralegal.",4,<strong>Mary</strong>
1,19,You're a paralegal.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,That was not funny.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Not funny, dude.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"I know, it was hilarious.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,Why would you do that?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,I did it to prove a point.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,What point?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",58,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,She slapped me and stormed off.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,19,"Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,Your room?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,19,"Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3",34,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,19,"Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,20,Van Smoot is available.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Oh, my God!",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River. It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding, but it was never available. And then, suddenly, it was.",32,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,20,There was a cancellation two months from now.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Todd and Valerie?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple.",27,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,20,We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,20,"Hello, Marshall. Lily.",3,<strong>Todd</strong>
1,20,Todd. Valerie. Stairs.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,You're a wonder.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,How are you going to get everything done?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.,14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,20,Was it...?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Lil, you know I can't promise that.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Who?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.,21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,John &quot;Bonzo&quot; Bonham from Led Zeppelin?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",35,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Well, then... I have to say no.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Let me check their Website.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?",38,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Wow.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,We already have a caterer.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.,16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,A prom? Can... can we go to that?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Yeah. No, they won't.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Why not?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"No sweat, we'll just sneak in.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Yes, we are. It's the only way.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Well...,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"No, Barney.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom.",11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,20,I'll go with you.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Really?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Lesbian.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,The cough is supposed to cover the &quot;lesbian.&quot;,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got &quot;statutory&quot; written all over your body.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"Hey, why don't we all go?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Yeah.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"All right, what do you think?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Horrible.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,You're gonna make such a great dad.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",45,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,All right.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,I didn't know I still had this.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,The dress I wore to my actual prom.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.",25,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,"Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in!,10,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,"Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"You mean happy for us, right, babe?",7,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,"Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.",8,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,"Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,We got to go. See ya.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Bye, have fun. See you.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"So, what, we ready for tonight?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Shot of Jim Beam?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,Yeah.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Yes!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,What?!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",39,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Is this gonna work?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",29,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Uh, you're adults.",3,<strong>Security guard</strong>
1,20,"Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,And you're just finding a band?,6,<strong>Security guard</strong>
1,20,"Hey, ho, hey!",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student.",16,<strong>Security guard</strong>
1,20,Wow. &quot;Ma'am?&quot; Check and mate.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,We don't have that kind of money.,7,<strong>Boy</strong>
1,20,For free.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Oh, hell yeah!",3,<strong>Boy</strong>
1,20,"Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Hi. Shall we?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.,10,<strong>Boy</strong>
1,20,"Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,We're in!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Thank you. We're going to take a break.,8,<strong>Singer</strong>
1,20,"Oh, you're kidding me.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?",11,<strong>Boy #1</strong>
1,20,"Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them.",23,<strong>Boy #1</strong>
1,20,"Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play &quot;Good Feeling&quot; by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fianc√© wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play &quot;Good Feeling&quot; because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",75,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.",26,<strong>Man</strong>
1,20,"So, you buzzing, baby?",4,<strong>Boy #1</strong>
1,20,My phlegm feels looser.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,You know it.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"I'd have your back, too.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,That's cool.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Okay, Ted. <em></em> Hello.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for &quot;Good Feeling&quot; and bring it out here, like, now.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,What'd she say? What'd she say?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",56,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,19,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.,12,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!",32,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,"Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"You're, you're breaking up with me?",6,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,"There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",39,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby.",24,<strong>Scooter</strong>
1,20,Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"It's just one dance, God!",5,<strong>Boy #2</strong>
1,20,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Well, we did promise them one dance.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.",36,<strong>Andrew</strong>
1,20,"No, you won't.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,I won't?,2,<strong>Andrew</strong>
1,20,"No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering &quot;Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?&quot;",46,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend?,8,<strong>Andrew</strong>
1,20,"So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?",11,<strong>Boy #1</strong>
1,20,"Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me.",8,<strong>Giant Turtle</strong>
1,20,Okay.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,How'd you get in here?,5,<strong>Giant Turtle</strong>
1,20,"What's it to you, giant turtle?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"It's me, Barney.",3,<strong>Giant Turtle</strong>
1,20,"Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,She's in the bathroom.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,All right.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,How did you guys get in here?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,We just snuck in the back.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,29,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Hey, bro, have you seen my fianc√©e Lily?",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Your fianc√©e? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble.",13,<strong>Andrew</strong>
1,20,"Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.",26,<strong>Andrew</strong>
1,20,"Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Yah! Nunchaku!,2,<strong>Andrew</strong>
1,20,I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",38,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,25,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy caf√©s for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",85,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Marshall.,1,<strong>Man</strong>
1,20,"Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Yeah.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,It works.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Violent Femmes. I love this song.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Me, too.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,Yeah.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Yeah. So field hockey, huh?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,Shut up.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"Trespassing, assaulting a minor. This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000.",11,<strong>Security guard #1</strong>
1,20,"We can have you guys arrested, you know that?",9,<strong>Security guard #2</strong>
1,20,"Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,I totally could have taken that kid.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,Absolutely not.,2,<strong>Security guards</strong>
1,20,"You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,Hey!,1,<strong>Security guard #1</strong>
1,20,"You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.,12,<strong>Singer</strong>
1,20,So how was your first prom?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,"So, basically, it was a prom.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,20,I'll take what I can get.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,20,"And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,20,"So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,20,"Yeah, it's good.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,20,"Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,21,What's going on?,3,<strong>Woman</strong>
1,21,"Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>

1,21,"Oh, thank God, you're here.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,What is going on?!,4,<strong>Paramedic</strong>
1,21,I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.,19,<strong>Barney</strong>

1,21,You've had a terrible fall.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"No, I haven't.",3,<strong>Woman</strong>

1,21,It works!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,I cannot believe that she gave him her number.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,21,"I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,21,It's not like I have a list.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>

1,21,"Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,That's not hard. I know at least...,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",43,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,You're never going to find this girl.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,21,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,That's the plan.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it.",24,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,"Whoa, you're up early.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Does Marshall know?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,He's still sound asleep.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"God, why didn't you throw it away?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"What's wrong, baby?",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,This is the high point of my day.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it.",41,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,"Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,So?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Oh! Sweet Lord.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,You?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,This is stupid.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...",7,<strong>Tracy</strong>
1,21,"I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Hello?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?,9,<strong>Man</strong>
1,21,Speaking.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.",23,<strong>Man</strong>
1,21,"Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate.",16,<strong>Bob</strong>
1,21,I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.",30,<strong>Bob</strong>
1,21,So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.,10,<strong>Bob</strong>
1,21,"No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.,11,<strong>Bob</strong>
1,21,"So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.",69,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,"All right, fine. Set it up.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Tastes normal to me.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"Oh, God!",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,It got me as well.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Because now... you're in.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,39,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started...",25,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,Lily?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Hey, Ted, are you busy?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Um... yes.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",22,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"I can't, I'm waiting...",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Come on, Lily.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,But you see my point.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,"Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,And was she okay about pushing it back?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,You can never tell Marshall.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,I won't.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,I swear on Luke and Leia.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Did you talk to Marshall about it?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,That was you? Awesome!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",44,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,You don't want to get married.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,31,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",47,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",43,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,I don't think you're stupid.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,I love Marshall.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,All done.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Ted, let's go to New Haven.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Lily, don't do this to yourself.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",38,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, &quot;Yep. That was a mistake.&quot; So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",112,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"I don't know. You said &quot;mistake&quot; a lot. Lily, don't do this.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Forgive you for what? <em></em> Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. <em></em> Hey, I need a big favor.",65,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Anything, bro.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,No.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,It's kind of an emergency.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,What are you doing in Duchess County?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Is that Ted?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Don't you have a big date tonight?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,So what are you doing in Duchess County?,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,No!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",39,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,"Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Taking off for the night.,5,<strong>Tracy</strong>
1,21,"Thanks, Tracy.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?,11,<strong>Tracy</strong>
1,21,Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,No.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,That would have been bad.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,21,Horrible.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,"Need a ride, cowboy?",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Candy?!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Oh, come on.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,I like your hat.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took &quot;highlights&quot; to mean, &quot;I want to look like a tiger,&quot; hence the hat.",28,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Oh. I gotta see this.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,No way.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,I read that. More like &quot;Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.&quot;,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,We're not indoors. We're in a van.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Never. What else?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,She loves lasagna.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Barf.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,What else?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,And she's looking to get married and have kids?,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Really? You don't want kids?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"Hey, thanks for picking me up.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,Thanks.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",29,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,You're going to show me your hair?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,You just made my night.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Go.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,21,"Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Hey, guys.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Hi.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,You think you might want to... drink the milk?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",32,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,I didn't go.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,What? Why?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Why? She sounds perfect.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,21,"Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.",18,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,21,"Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,21,"Hey, is this milk any good?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,21,Even really really dumb mistakes.,5,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

1,22,It was May of 2006 in New York City and life was good. But everything was about to change.,19,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,22,So... what do you think?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. <em></em> Ow! What the hell?",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,That wasn't me. That was the universe.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,22,"And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin?",30,<strong>Weather man</strong>
1,22,"Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.",11,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.",9,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,Have a great night.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"And, we're clear.",3,<strong>Man</strong>
1,22,"Bummer. I was hoping to finally have s*x with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.",13,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,"Well, I'd give you the &quot;I don't date coworkers&quot; speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.",28,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,"Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, &quot;enough&quot;?",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,21,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,She should be here any second.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?",10,<strong>Musician</strong>
1,22,"Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Damn it.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Hello.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Yes, I gave it to you.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.",38,<strong>Voice mail</strong>
1,22,"Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Summer fellowship?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Just knock. Okay.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Hi.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Hi.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",50,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Yes. No. I don't know.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Those are the three options.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Ted, this is so...",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.",11,<strong>Musician</strong>
1,22,"No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Sure. We're not getting any pizza.,6,<strong>Musician</strong>
1,22,Okay. Let's talk.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. <em></em> You're crazy.",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Right. Come on.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,I know. But... come on...,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",36,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,I thought that thing was canceled.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Well, it's back on.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Since when?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Since like an hour ago.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin?,16,<strong>Weather man</strong>
1,22,"Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York.",57,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,And we're clear.,3,<strong>Man</strong>
1,22,You're leaving?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.,24,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,"Oh, congratulations.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Congratulations yourself.,2,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,What do you mean?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.",24,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,"Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Yes, what?",2,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,"Yes, let's go get dinner.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.,13,<strong>Sandy</strong>
1,22,"Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,21,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I don't-I don't know.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"So, what? You actually like this guy now?",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I don't know.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Are you gonna hook up with him?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I don't know.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Yes, you do.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,I don't plan out every...,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, &quot;Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?&quot; No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",44,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",41,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I need to think about this.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Fine.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Then I guess it's not meant to be.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Nice try, buddy.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Screw that. This ain't over.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Unpause?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Unpause.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days.",29,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,22,A painting fellowship?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,I was never going to take it.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,In California?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,I was never going to take it.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,What are you talking about?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,27,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",40,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Yeah.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Are you still in touch with her?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Did you just say a &quot;rain dance&quot;?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,A rain dance.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,A dance to make it rain.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Yes. <em>(Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him)</em> We're finding Penelope!,24,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"No, we are not!",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Yes, we are!",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Why the hell should I help you?,7,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"We had s*x twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?",17,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,Twice!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Barney, there is no way...",5,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,Shh!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Seriously, come on.",3,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Why?,1,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,There's this girl...,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"&quot;There's this girl.&quot; You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.",33,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?",8,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,Absolutely.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Kind of like Barney?,4,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,Kind of.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Hey.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,You hit on my mom!,5,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,We weren't exclusive!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,I'm in.,2,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.,14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
1,22,Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.,9,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,I will throw you off this roof.,7,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,There's so much of your mom in you.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,And she's been throwing up ever since.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?,9,<strong>Veterinary</strong>
1,22,"Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",30,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Oh, that's so sweet.",4,<strong>Veterinary</strong>
1,22,"Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,Nobody does that.,3,<strong>Veterinary</strong>
1,22,Exactly.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.",22,<strong>Veterinary</strong>
1,22,So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",49,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",29,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,So now we've gone from &quot;I was never gonna do it&quot; to &quot;I need to do this&quot;? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?,29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Maybe not.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Pause.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"So, are you just, like, starving?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Totally. Red Lobster?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"I wouldn't dare. <em></em> Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy...",16,<strong>Waiters</strong>
1,22,"Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I think so.,3,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I think so.,3,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,No.,1,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,No?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I've read extensively on the subject,6,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,Have you ever seen a rain dance?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I've seen a film strip.,5,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"What do you mean &quot;we,&quot; white man?",7,<strong>Penelope</strong>
1,22,"How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,I think there's still one left.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Dibs.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Unpause?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Unpause.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,34,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Why not?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",46,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,Marshall...,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,"'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
1,22,"Marshall, I love you.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
1,22,Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>

1,22,"Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,A rain dance.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Yeah. I know that.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Well, then why are you doing this?",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",59,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"Oh, come on!",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.,20,<strong>Weather man</strong>
1,22,How about that? He did it.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
1,22,"Robin! Hey, Robin! <em></em> Oh, thank God you're here!",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,My camping trip got rained out.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,I know. I'm sorry.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,It's not your fault.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Yeah, it is. Come down here.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,It's pouring. You come up.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"No, you have to come down here.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,Why?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,"I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,I was gonna...,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
1,22,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
1,22,"And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same.

2,1,"Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,1,Can I go to the bathroom?,6,<strong>Ted's son</strong>
2,1,"No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. <em>(In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance)</em> In fact, day one was amazing.

2,1,"For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,1,I should call her.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,1,"No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",43,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,1,You're a good friend Ted.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,1,"Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,1,"You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,1,Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,1,"Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,1,Sure.<strong>,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,1,Really? Why not?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,1,56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.,13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

2,2,She's moved on?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,2,"Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?",34,<strong>Robin</strong>

2,2,"Wow. So, maybe I should call him?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,2,"Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word &quot;maybe&quot;. &quot;Maybe&quot; cannot be in your vocabulary.

2,2,"No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you.",46,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,"There is no &quot;would&quot; in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.",33,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,That's not possible.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,A twin isn't the same person.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"Of course, it is. What do you think &quot;identical&quot; means? &quot;Ident-&quot; - same. &quot;-ical&quot; - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,Fine.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,Ah!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,"But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.,15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,2,How are you doing?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,2,It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,But they're twins.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,Ted's my best friend.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is.

2,2,It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,Can we please get back together?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,2,"All that crap you said to me about &quot;we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.&quot;. It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.",41,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,Can we please get back together?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,2,"Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,2,Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.,27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. <em>(Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later).</em> And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>

2,2,"Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,2,"So then, I was promoted to assistant m√©nage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? <em>(Lily arrives.)</em> Lily?",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,2,"You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! <em></em>",7,<strong>Lily</strong>

2,3,Robin...! <em>(She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)</em>,12,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.",27,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend.",16,at the apartment.</em><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.",18,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Coffee?,1,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real.",20,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.",4,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,Good to see you.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...",14,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,I love your hair.,4,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.",24,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8",13,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,Um...,1,<strong>Lily</strong> <em>(looking at Marshall)</em>
2,3,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,Why would it?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"&quot;Brother and sister&quot;?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. <em></em>",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,See? Not awkward at all.,5,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"Hello, everyone.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,Hi.,1,<strong>All</strong>
2,3,"Hello, Marshall.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Lily, that is a stunning dress.",6,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, &quot;Hey, we're all family.&quot; Right, bro? Ooh, ah...",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,What's wrong?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... <em></em> Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.",45,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.,9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,Hello.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Oh, hi.",2,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,"Hey, Marshall.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?",16,Marshall
2,3,"Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (<em>Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips)</em> What are you doing?",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. <em></em> Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.",36,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,Take off your dress.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,Take off the rest of your pants.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,I really wasn't expecting that to happen.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,Seduce you? You seduced me.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,You went to San Francisco for three months.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,How is that seducing you?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,"All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,You are evil.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,Smile!,1,<strong>The waitress</strong> <em>(taking a photo)</em>
2,3,I'm going to kill him.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,I can't say I blame you.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.,10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous.",18,at the apartment.</em><strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,3,"Barney, what are you doing here?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.,23,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,What?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about&#058; baseball.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,But I'm your best friend.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Well, actually Marshall's my...",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,I'm the most important person in your life.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Well, Robin's actually...",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Ted.,1,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,I know you've all been excited to meet...,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint &quot;Bless This Mess&quot; pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? <em>(Ted's parents and Barney laugh)</em>,34,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,Hello.,1,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,Hello.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?",16,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,A real looker.,3,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,"That's funny, I didn't even &quot;look&quot; in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.",21,<strong>Barney</strong> <em>(laughing)</em>
2,3,I love salmon risotto.,4,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,I know.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.,16,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Stop it! Don't, don't!",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,Can I help?,3,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Well, funny you should ask...",5,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!",6,<em>At &quot;Casa a pezzi&quot;. Barney is playing the piano.</em><strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,"That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.",10,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"No, I'm kind of tired.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Me, too.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.,10,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,Cervezas? Did he fall?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.",14,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"St. Peter's, 8",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,I'll save you a seat.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?",8,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,Robin.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Susan, her name is Virginia.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,Why?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety.",20,<strong>Ted's father</strong> <em>(talking to a girl)</em>
2,3,Wow. You're like a hero.,5,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,3,"Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"You poor, brave man.",4,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,3,Why don't you give the guy a hug?,8,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,I'm... oh. <em>.</em>,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,Sure.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",15,<strong>Barney</strong>

2,3,"Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,"Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use &quot;83%&quot;?",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>

2,3,You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>

2,3,Hooray?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.",32,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,"Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,What happened to Marshall and Lily?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,3,They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>

2,3,"No, it wasn't a snap decision.",6,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,We'd been separated almost two years.,6,<strong>Ted's father</strong>

2,3,"Me, too.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.,20,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,"Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,Did you Mystic Tan your calves?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,3,I withdraw the question.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,3,We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.,9,<em>Outside.</em><strong>Ted's father</strong>

2,3,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"Oh, great story. At a bar.",6,<strong>Ted's father</strong>

2,3,I think it was an Irish bar.,7,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,"I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,We just realized we're very different people.,7,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,"Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth.",14,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.,9,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,17,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,"On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.",29,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.",25,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,But we love Robin.,4,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight.",12,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,We'll see you inside.,4,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,Sorry.,1,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,Wow.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,They love me!,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,3,So we are definitely going to try and communicate more.,10,later.</em><strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,"From now on, full disclosure.",5,<strong>Ted's father</strong>
2,3,"Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,I'm gonna get some juice.,5,<strong>Ted's mother</strong>
2,3,No. No.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,3,You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker.,9,<strong>Ted's father</strong>

2,4,"Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is.",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,4,"Well, we just had our first fight.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,We had our first fight.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? <em>.</em>",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"And if we don't get it, we could go under.",10,Ted
2,4,"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,No.,1,<strong>Both Marshall and Barney</strong>
2,4,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",8,Marshall
2,4,"Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Wow, so it's the whole package.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, you did.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,Had to.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, you did.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Had to.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",30,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, you did.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,That wasn't one.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Hey.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,How was your day?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Good.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Robin!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,You should work at a suicide hotline.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,And then it got ugly.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like <em>Die Hard</em>. But <em>Field of Dreams</em>? Once is more than enough.",44,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is <em>Field of Dreams</em>?,24,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",32,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,I guess I don't know how to do that.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",42,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,What the hell comes before &quot;Q&quot;?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Can we talk about something else?,6,<strong>Barney</strong> <em>(brokenly)</em>
2,4,"You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",60,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Your job's not boring.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Robin thinks so.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,I love it when you quote Scripture.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"That's 'cause you're always like... <em></em> &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot;. If it were me, I'd be like... <em></em> &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot;. Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",30,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..",32,<strong>Marshall</strong> <em>(suavely)</em>
2,4,"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot;. Trust me.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,17,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Yes, she did.",3,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,Mm-hmm.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"No. Hey, Lily. You still single?",6,<strong>Carl</strong>
2,4,Yes.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.,16,<strong>Carl</strong>
2,4,"Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,Only if you're into it. It's on me.,8,<strong>Carl</strong>
2,4,Thanks.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,I wonder where Ted went.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Ted Mosby, the architect?",4,<strong>A girl</strong>
2,4,"Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?,11,<strong>Girl 1</strong>
2,4,"Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me.",11,<strong>Girl 1</strong>
2,4,"Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",52,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Yeah.,1,<strong>Girls</strong>
2,4,"He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",33,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",48,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.,11,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"All right, we'll swing by the party.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however...",33,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,4,"Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!,8,<strong>Guy 1</strong>
2,4,That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.,10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,4,"Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!",36,<strong>Guy 2</strong>
2,4,"Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here.",14,<strong>Guy 2</strong>
2,4,"Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.,11,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,I know you would. It's the job.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.,9,<strong>Guy 2</strong> <em>(to guy 1)</em>
2,4,No way.,2,<strong>Guy 1</strong>
2,4,"Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?",4,<strong>Girl 2</strong>
2,4,"I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",35,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move.",27,<strong>Guy 2</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days.",26,<strong>Girl 2</strong>
2,4,"Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,You should sue her.,4,<strong>Girl 2</strong>
2,4,"Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,On the grounds of... shut up.,6,<strong>Kara</strong>
2,4,That's our Attorney General.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,4,See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,28,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,The girl with the smackable ass.,6,<strong>Guy 2</strong>
2,4,"Yes, that's the young lady.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?",15,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",34,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Yay!,1,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Wait, let me just check with my friend.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Okay.,1,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Um... only always.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Let's go.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Hello.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,"Uh, okay. Bye. <em></em> Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd.",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,You're going to need to refresh my memory.,8,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,"Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory.",15,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,So these guys... One of them's an architect.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Ted Mosby, the architect?",4,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,That's the one.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Oh, yeah, he was here.",5,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,"And then I was all, &quot;No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time.&quot; And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,I live across the street.,5,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,That is one hell of a non sequitur.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,You want to come over?,5,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. <em>(The girl jumps on Ted's back)</em>",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"I'll see you at book club, Vinny.",7,<strong>Girl</strong> <em>(to the bouncer)</em>
2,4,Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudit√©s.,6,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,Nice. Giddy up!,3,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Galloping.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"You proved it, all right? The whole &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot; things works.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Architects rule! Whoo-hee!,3,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,It is tonight. Whoo!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,You know this girl. Where does she live?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.,10,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,"Well, I'm out of money.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"I'm cashed, too.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,I'll take your purse.,4,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,My purse?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, my girl likes clutches.",5,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,"Okay, fine.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,21,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.",8,<strong>Bouncer</strong>
2,4,"Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,Yeah... And steal her purse.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",30,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"3-C, let's do this. You ready?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,Should I just kick the door in?,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,I'm the problem.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,25,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,Let's do this.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Bring it. <em></em>,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,What do you think you're...? Barney?,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.,12,<strong>Barney</strong> <em>(tied up to the bed)</em>
2,4,"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Ted? He's at work.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,How did you get here?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Awesome story. As per usual.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,11,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Yes, she did.",3,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.",19,<strong>Barney</strong> <em>(coming back in the bar)</em>
2,4,"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.,14,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, stay <em>(mouthing &quot;go&quot;)</em>",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Excuse us for one second. <em></em> Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, you did.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Yeah, had to. See ya. <em></em>",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.",7,<strong>Barney</strong> <em>(to the girl)</em>
2,4,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.",10,<strong>Girl</strong>
2,4,Ted Mosby... Architect.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!",3,<strong>Anna</strong>
2,4,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Galloping.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"All right, you proved it. The whole &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot; thing works.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.,3,<strong>Anna</strong>
2,4,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,4,It is tonight.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,But why would you use Ted's name?,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole &quot;using my real name&quot; thing.,24,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,"Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,This is how people act in relationships.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,And that's why I avoid relationships.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,4,"And thus ended this chapter of, &quot;Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand.&quot; Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",29,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a &quot;A.&quot; A... A... I'll just put &quot;resident.&quot; Go, go, go, go.",38,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,4,Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.,46,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,4,Hey.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,Hey. What are you doing here?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of <em>Field of Dreams</em>. I fell asleep half way through.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,4,"Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",39,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,4,"Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",24,<strong>Ted</strong>

2,6,And she did find it.,5,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,6,I'm going to be a life coach.,7,<strong>Lily</strong> <em>(coming in Robin's)</em>

2,6,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,I'm sorry.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. <em>.</em>",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,What do you want?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>

2,6,No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,20,<strong>Robin</strong>

2,6,"Really? Laid, you say?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,She hot?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,A what?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>

2,6,Classic.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,6,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"So, where should we eat today? <em></em> Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? <em>(the girl leaves, crying)",18,<strong>Ted</strong>

2,6,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,What would I be doing?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,28,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh, right, is that the...?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,Yeah. Here's the model.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,And the way it...,4,<strong>Lily</strong>

2,6,And the two little...,4,<strong>Lily</strong>

2,6,Ah.,1,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Nice to meet you.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",21,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"I, uh... I am an architect.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",12,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",32,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Absolutely.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,So you're going to design the...,6,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Styrofoam trees.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Once again, with feeling.",4,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Styrofoam trees.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Styrofoam trees!,2,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Styrofoam trees!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? <em></em>",33,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Man, that guy is a total, well... <em></em>",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",109,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,6,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,6,Tell me what you want or get out.,8,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.,9,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. <em></em> You know what I mean",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Did you show lily your design?,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,What design?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,It's nothing.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. <em></em> All right, enough!",34,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,Hmm... C minus.,3,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",23,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,26,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Okay, I'm done.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,Great. Thanks.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",19,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Too green.,2,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Too green?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",36,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,I can't un-picture it.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",6,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,What? What's gone?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,8,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",20,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",17,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? <em>(Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)</em>",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Hey.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,That's easy. I took it.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,Why?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,It's simple.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university,23,<em>[FLASHBACK]</em><strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",18,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",23,<strong>Mr Druthers <em>(to a kid)</em></strong>
2,6,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,What does his ball have to do with anything?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",41,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Why? Was he being mean?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,You know about this?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,I gave them to you for your birthday.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,I prefer to call them &quot;justice khakis.&quot;,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,So is being mean.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Well, that's why I left a note.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,A note?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",31,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,"I know, I know.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,I think I'm falling in love with you.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",15,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",16,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, &quot;who wants espresso?&quot; So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",39,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,No.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"What do you mean, no?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Everybody get in here now!,5,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,&quot;Who wants espresso?&quot;,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",23,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Interesting.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever &quot;allegedly&quot; did!",69,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,Then you're fired.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,So you're going back over there?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,6,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the &quot;cougar&quot; once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,"Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",17,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",39,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,6,Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.,11,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,6,"Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",26,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",31,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Lily was mentally deranged.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,11,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Lily was mentally deranged!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",9,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,The clients are here.,4,<strong>Man</strong>
2,6,Excellent. Bring them in.,4,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,6,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",11,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,That's a pen1s!,3,<strong>Client</strong>
2,6,That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,18,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?,10,<strong>Client</strong>
2,6,Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,12,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",14,<strong>Client</strong>
2,6,The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,20,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,6,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Ted, what are you doing?",5,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,I have another design.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Sit down, shut up right now.",6,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,6,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,Probably!,1,<strong>All</strong>
2,6,"Congrats, ted.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,6,"Barney! Oh, my god!",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,6,What happened?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,6,He broke his hip.,4,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>

2,7,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, &quot;dude, my semester is gonna be this.&quot;",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",46,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"Really? Laid, you say?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,She hot?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,A what?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...",23,<strong>Lily</strong> <em>(arriving)</em>
2,7,Classic.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"So, where should we eat today? <em></em> Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? <em>(the girl leaves, crying)",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,What would I be doing?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,28,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh, right, is that the...?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,Yeah. Here's the model.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,And the way it...,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,And the two little...,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,I know.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,It is just...,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Spectacular? Why, thank you.",4,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong> <em>(arriving)</em>
2,7,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Ah.,1,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Nice to meet you.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?",21,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"I, uh... I am an architect.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?",12,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?",32,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Absolutely.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,So you're going to design the...,6,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Styrofoam trees.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Once again, with feeling.",4,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Styrofoam trees.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Styrofoam trees!,2,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Styrofoam trees!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? <em></em>",33,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Man, that guy is a total, well... <em></em>",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",109,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,Who do you rather have grading your papers,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,7,Tell me what you want or get out.,8,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.,9,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. <em></em> You know what I mean",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Did you show lily your design?,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,What design?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,It's nothing.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. <em></em> All right, enough!",34,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,Hmm... C minus.,3,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.",23,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,26,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Okay, I'm done.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,Great. Thanks.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.",19,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Too green.,2,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Too green?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?",36,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,I can't un-picture it.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!",6,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,What? What's gone?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,8,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.",20,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.",17,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? <em>(Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)</em>",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Hey.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,That's easy. I took it.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,Why?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,It's simple.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university,23,<em>[FLASHBACK]</em><strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.",18,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!",23,<strong>Mr Druthers <em>(to a kid)</em></strong>
2,7,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,What does his ball have to do with anything?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",41,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Why? Was he being mean?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,You know about this?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,I gave them to you for your birthday.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,I prefer to call them &quot;justice khakis.&quot;,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,So is being mean.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Well, that's why I left a note.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,A note?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",31,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"I know, I know.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,I think I'm falling in love with you.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.",15,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,What? No.We had s*x yesterday.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.",16,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, &quot;who wants espresso?&quot; So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",39,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,No.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"What do you mean, no?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Everybody get in here now!,5,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,&quot;Who wants espresso?&quot;,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note.",23,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Interesting.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever &quot;allegedly&quot; did!",69,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,Then you're fired.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,So you're going back over there?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,7,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the &quot;cougar&quot; once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,"Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.",17,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",39,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,7,Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.,11,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>
2,7,"Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face.",26,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted.",31,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Lily was mentally deranged.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.,11,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Lily was mentally deranged!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?",9,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,The clients are here.,4,<strong>Man</strong>
2,7,Excellent. Bring them in.,4,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.,28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,7,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.",11,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,That's a pen1s!,3,<strong>Client</strong>
2,7,That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.,18,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?,10,<strong>Client</strong>
2,7,Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.,12,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",14,<strong>Client</strong>
2,7,The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.,20,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,7,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Ted, what are you doing?",5,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,I have another design.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Sit down, shut up right now.",6,<strong>Mr Druthers</strong>
2,7,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,Probably!,1,<strong>All</strong>
2,7,"Congrats, ted.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,7,"Barney! Oh, my god!",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,7,What happened?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,7,He broke his hip.,4,<strong>Pr Lewis</strong>

2,8,"Of course, I love you.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>

2,8,I had a speech prepared.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,8,"Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",34,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Yeah!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,You got it.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Hey, guys.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Wow. A pedicure.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,So are you in or not?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"No, we got to get going to the...",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.,13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,8,Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,You been here before?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Oh, uh, once or twice.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Barney!,1,<strong>Chinese 1</strong>

2,8,The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,I'm ready. Let's get married.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Yeah.,1,Ted and Robin
2,8,"Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Oh, really? Thanks.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Done. <em></em>,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. <em></em>,22,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,You guys want to go gamble?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"No, we got to go get the veil.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Yeah, okay.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. <em></em>",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Thanks.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,How are you feeling?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Great, a little nervous.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Yeah? Craps?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Not that nervous.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"No, I mean do you want to play craps.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Oh, yeah, definitely.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,What did you just say?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Barney, no.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Marshall, I'm your best man.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,You're not my best man.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Right here.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,You're not my best friend.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Right here.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,18 minutes...,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Of course.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Dude!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Unbelievable!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.,24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Your last lap dance ever.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Right. What?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Okay, I'm here. Right?",4,wearing a &quot;shirt boobs&quot;)</em>
2,8,"Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Does it smell like strippers in here?,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Hell, yeah, look at this. <em>(She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)</em>",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Hi. We're here to get married.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.,17,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?",7,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,"Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong> <em>(looking at Robin's shirt)</em>
2,8,It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.,22,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,"No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.",30,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,"Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.",22,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,Have you been outside?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",18,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,Bright side,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Yes! Continues? You mean &quot;start.&quot; He means &quot;start.&quot; We went to a strip club.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Twenty-seven.,1,Woman
2,8,Is there any way that we could get a license today?,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.",24,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,"Well, we're in love.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,What better reason could there be?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"The last one I heard was, &quot;I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,&quot; but, you know, give yours a whirl.",22,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,So we went to the courthouse.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,8,"God, this is taking forever.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Can't believe they're getting married.,5,<strong>Robin</strong> <em>(to Ted)</em>
2,8,"I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Ted, up here.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,Uhm?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,You were just staring at my shirt boobs.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",30,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Hey, it's Barney! Barney!",4,<strong>Chinese 2</strong>
2,8,Hi.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,<em></em>...suit up! <em> Legen-...-dary!</em>,4,<strong>Chinese 2</strong>
2,8,See you.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,What the hell was that?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,A... Chinese guy?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.,9,<strong>Woman 2</strong>
2,8,"Oh, really?!",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.",20,<strong>Woman 2</strong>
2,8,"Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Absolutely.,1,<strong>Woman 2</strong>
2,8,Really?!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.",19,<strong>Woman 2</strong>
2,8,Why are you doing this to us?!,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,'Cause you're on Candid Camera!,5,<strong>Woman 2</strong>
2,8,Really?!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,Is what I would say...,5,<strong>Woman 2</strong>
2,8,You know what? We get it.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",34,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Vultures.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Psst. <em></em>,2,<strong>Ted</strong> <em>(to Robin)</em>
2,8,What? Here?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,Yeah. Got a little time to kill.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,No. A little.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Something is seriously wrong with you.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"So what, is that a no?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"All right, let's do it.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"All right. Um, also...?",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Yes, I'll leave it on.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,Sweet.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.</em>",8,<em>Barney
2,8,"Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Turn it off.,3,<strong>Judge</strong>
2,8,Okay. May we please get married today?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?",40,<strong>Judge</strong>
2,8,What was what?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,That little look. What was that?,6,<strong>Judge</strong>
2,8,A look of love.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?",10,<strong>Judge</strong>
2,8,"You know, what's thick? what's thin?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,I have.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"All right, what was that look? What's going on?",9,<strong>Judge</strong>
2,8,They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.,26,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"No, we're not.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.,21,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.  Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?,18,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,This is my machine.,4,<strong>Woman</strong>
2,8,I should go talk to her.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"No, let me.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,Blackjack?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Yeah.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",47,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Nobody's gonna do that.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.",18,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,I can get us that money.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,How?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,18,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called &quot;Shing Hasabu Shing&quot;. Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",60,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.",24,Barney
2,8,"Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.",50,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
2,8,Do you understand what's happening?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Not a clue.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Do you think he's winning?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,I don't even know if he's playing.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Wait, I get it. I understand this game.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"No, you don't.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Wow. It's beautiful.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Thanks, Barney.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,Why can't I do it just a little?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,Okay. Let's get this started.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?",12,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,"You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.",23,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,"Yeah, serious is probably good.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"&quot;We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...&quot;",30,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,I never said &quot;never.&quot;,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"&quot;...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you.&quot; What was that?",26,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,What was what?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,That little look. You two just shared a look.,9,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,We don't want to do this.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,We don't.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
2,8,"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
2,8,You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
2,8,"Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",47,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",38,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,"I love you, Marshmallow.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,"I love you, too, Lilypad.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>

2,8,What?!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
2,8,Is that not right?,4,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
2,8,Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.,7,<strong>Captain</strong>
2,8,Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us!,4,<strong>Both Marshall and Lily</strong>

2,9,"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",15,Barney
2,9,It's true. They tell each other everything.,7,Ted
2,9,I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,13,Barney
2,9,Try me.,2,Lily
2,9,Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,11,Barney
2,9,Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,5,Lily
2,9,Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,5,Barney
2,9,"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",13,Lily
2,9,"OK, Seattle.",2,Barney
2,9,"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",14,Lily
2,9,Damn.,1,Barney
2,9,I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,14,Marshall
2,9,"Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",15,Ted
2,9,"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",46,Marshall
2,9,What happened next?,3,Lily
2,9,"Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.",6,(back to present scene) Ted
2,9,"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",10,Barney
2,9,You know?,2,Ted
2,9,"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p0rn, wait for it, ography.",26,Barney
2,9,"Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",12,Ted
2,9,"I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",15,Lily
2,9,Hey.,1,Ted
2,9,What? The walls are thin.,5,Lily
2,9,That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,7,Ted
2,9,You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,18,Marshall
2,9,Married? What does have to do with the mall?,9,Ted
2,9,"Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",44,Marshall
2,9,We're not getting married at the mall.,7,Lily
2,9,Just meet with the guy.,5,Marshall
2,9,She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,6,Ted
2,9,"Because she already got married, at the mall.",8,Marshall
2,9,"No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",12,Lily
2,9,"Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",14,Ted
2,9,She's a pretty private person.,5,Marshall
2,9,Except when she's talking about...,5,Lily
2,9,A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,19,Robin
2,9,What do you think of this wedding cake?,8,Lily
2,9,"Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",27,Robin
2,9,No.,1,Lily
2,9,"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",20,Robin
2,9,They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,11,Barney
2,9,"So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",9,Ted
2,9,"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",23,Marshall
2,9,"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",12,Barney
2,9,Thank you Barney.,3,Ted
2,9,'Cause it's p0rn.,3,Barney
2,9,I need another beer.,4,Ted
2,9,Robin is not in p0rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,12,Marshall
2,9,"20,000 says it's p0rn.",4,Barney
2,9,"I don't have 20,000.",4,Marshall
2,9,"Well then, what do you have?",6,Barney
2,9,Well.,1,Marshall
2,9,No.,1,Lily
2,9,I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,8,Barney
2,9,"Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",13,Ted
2,9,What the hell's a slap bet?,6,Lily
2,9,"Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",20,Marshall
2,9,Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall,10,Lily
2,9,"Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",8,Lily
2,9,"Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney",14,Marshall
2,9,"And your tombstone will read, &quot;got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.&quot;",13,Marshall
2,9,"All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",13,Ted
2,9,You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,14,Lily
2,9,"Yeah, you're right.",3,Ted
2,9,Husband.,1,Ted
2,9,There's no 'p' in husband.,5,Robin
2,9,"Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",9,Ted
2,9,"Fine, I'll take it back.",5,Ted
2,9,"Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",46,Ted
2,9,Huh.,1,Robin
2,9,"I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",15,Ted
2,9,Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted,8,Robin
2,9,What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted,7,Robin
2,9,"Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",7,Robin
2,9,"Just say, &quot;no, I'm not married.&quot;",6,Ted
2,9,"I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",23,Robin
2,9,Oh.,1,Ted
2,9,You have a husband? Robin,5,Ted
2,9,Why didn't you get divorced?,5,Ted
2,9,"He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",13,Robin
2,9,"Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",17,Ted
2,9,I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,23,Robin
2,9,OK.,1,Ted
2,9,Your hand is monstrous.,4,Barney
2,9,"Well, what did you expect? You've seen my pen1s.",9,Marshall
2,9,I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,8,Lily
2,9,How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,16,Ted
2,9,No I didn't.,3,Lily
2,9,"Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",20,Lily
2,9,"Fine, Robin's married.",3,Ted
2,9,Ha ha ha.,3,Marshall
2,9,"Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",16,Lily
2,9,"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",23,Ted
2,9,I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,8,Barney
2,9,What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,16,Ted
2,9,"Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",21,Lily
2,9,It's serious to me.,4,Ted
2,9,"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",31,Marshall
2,9,I can see my hand print on your face.,9,Marshall
2,9,"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p0rn from Canada I have to go through.",19,Barney
2,9,I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,9,Marshall
2,9,Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,9,Barney
2,9,"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p0rn.",10,Lily
2,9,"Canadian p0rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go &quot;oat&quot; of my mind.",43,Barney
2,9,Hey.,1,Ted
2,9,"Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",18,Marshall
2,9,"Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",8,Ted
2,9,Robin's not married.,3,Marshall
2,9,"What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",9,Ted
2,9,I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,18,Marshall
2,9,There must be some mistake.,5,Ted
2,9,"I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",13,Marshall
2,9,"So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",22,Ted
2,9,"You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",32,Marshall
2,9,"Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",24,Ted
2,9,Thanks Ted.,2,Robin
2,9,"Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",15,Ted
2,9,I say we just move on.,6,Robin
2,9,"In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin",31,Ted
2,9,"Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",6,Ted
2,9,Sit down or buffet.,4,Ted
2,9,Um...,1,Robin
2,9,Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,7,Ted
2,9,"No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",42,Robin
2,9,Hm. Band of DJ?,4,Ted
2,9,"String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",30,Robin
2,9,How many bridesmaids? Robin,4,Ted
2,9,Flowers? Robin,2,Ted
2,9,Color scheme?,2,Ted
2,9,Dusty rose and sienna.,4,Robin
2,9,Husband's name?,2,Ted
2,9,Um.,1,Robin
2,9,You were never married.,4,Ted
2,9,Yes I was.,3,Robin
2,9,No you weren't.,3,Ted
2,9,How do you know?,4,Robin
2,9,I looked it up at the library.,7,Ted
2,9,What library?,2,Robin
2,9,The one on 5th.,4,Ted
2,9,When did you go?,4,Robin
2,9,Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,14,Ted
2,9,"I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",12,Robin
2,9,I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,7,Ted
2,9,"Fine, Marshall looked it up in school.",7,(Robin looks at Ted) Ted
2,9,You told Marshall?,3,Robin
2,9,You lied to me!,4,Ted
2,9,"See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",28,Robin
2,9,But it was a fake secret.,6,Ted
2,9,"Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",25,Robin
2,9,"Testing me, that's insane.",4,Ted
2,9,"Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",18,Robin
2,9,That wasn't a real secret.,5,Ted
2,9,"Yeah, but it could have been.",6,Robin
2,9,You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,14,Ted
2,9,He moved there for business.,5,Robin
2,9,"You, you got something to say to me?",8,Barney
2,9,What are you talking about? Barney,6,Marshall
2,9,How could you possibly know that?,6,Marshall
2,9,And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed. What about you?,14,(flashback of Lily and Marshall talking in bed) Lily
2,9,"Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",44,Marshall
2,9,You told him? Lily,4,Marshall
2,9,Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,11,Barney
2,9,Barney gets three slaps.,4,Lily
2,9,Three?,1,Marshall
2,9,One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,12,Lily
2,9,Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall,8,Barney
2,9,I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,28,Ted
2,9,"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",32,Robin
2,9,So I just got a very interesting phone call.,9,Barney
2,9,What are you talking about?,5,Ted
2,9,I know Robin's secret.,4,Barney
2,9,What?,1,Robin
2,9,"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin",14,Barney
2,9,"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",8,Barney
2,9,Yeah. No I don't.,4,Ted
2,9,What?,1,Barney
2,9,Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,13,Ted
2,9,"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",46,Barney
2,9,"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",12,Barney
2,9,"Barney, don't, okay.",3,Robin
2,9,"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",18,Barney
2,9,"No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",8,Ted
2,9,"No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",34,Robin
2,9,Are you as terrified as I am?,7,Lily
2,9,I don't wanna get slapped again.,6,Marshall
2,9,I wanna stress that I was young.,7,Robin
2,9,Yeah you were.,3,Barney
2,9,And I didn't know any better.,6,Robin
2,9,They never do.,3,Barney
2,9,And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,9,Robin
2,9,It always does.,3,Barney
2,9,"Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?",27,Robin Sparkles
2,9,Oh my God.,3,Ted
2,9,"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",25,Barney
2,9,What the hell was that?,5,Robin
2,9,"I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win.",11,Ted
2,9,"p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing.",11,Robin
2,9,"I know, how about I sing you a song!",9,Robin Sparkles
2,9,"Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori.",11,Robin Sparkles
2,9,I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,8,Robin
2,9,"Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about.",20,Robin Sparkles
2,9,This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,9,Lily
2,9,That's you?,2,Marshall
2,9,Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,32,Robin
2,9,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today.",15,Robin Sparkles
2,9,This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,10,Marshall
2,9,The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,9,Robin
2,9,"Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p0rn.",18,Marshall
2,9,And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,13,Lily
2,9,Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,7,Marshall
2,9,"Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",8,Ted
2,9,Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend.,16,Robin Sparkles
2,9,"OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",30,Lily
2,9,Cool.,1,Ted
2,9,Go with the 10 now.,5,Ted
2,9,"No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",10,Robin
2,9,"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",22,Ted
2,9,I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,8,Barney
2,9,Good call.,2,Robin
2,9,Horrible call.,2,Ted
2,9,"Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",17,Marshall
2,9,Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall,10,Robin Sparkles
2,9,"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",14,Lily
2,9,"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin",8,Barney
2,9,"Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",43,Ted
2,9,"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",12,Robin
2,9,Aw.,1,Barney
2,9,That's one.,2,Marshall
2,9,"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!",15,Robin Sparkles
2,9,Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin,10,Barney
2,9,There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me.,41,Robin Sparkles
2,9,But don't forget the robot.,5,Robot
2,9,The robot! Hey!,3,Marshall
2,9,"But, baby, I don't wanna wait.",6,Robin Sparkles
2,9,"No, she doesn't wanna wait.",5,Ted
2,9,"I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall . Let's go to the mall ...",46,Robin Sparkles

2,10,And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.,11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>

2,10,</strong> He was a little bit way into black guys.,10,<strong>James

But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement.

2,11,Another round!,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.,15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,The best friend's job is to call me that word?,10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.",27,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Then why don't you say it now?,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,Grinch. You timed that didn't you?,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Perfectly.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,"Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, yeah. &quot;I'm sorry&quot; were the first words out of my mouth.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.",22,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?,11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,No!,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Why not?,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Ted Vivian Mosby!,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,That's not my middle name.,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?,8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,Like you've never said that word.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet.,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,Are you sick?,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,"No, I meant do you have a cold?",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.",44,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.",20,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"I don't see any mistletoe, but...",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh! Oh, God!",3,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,11,Uh... &quot;Bless you&quot; would have been nice.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,You're sick.,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,I'm not sick.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,You're sick.,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?,15,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,"Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,You sure this is gonna work?,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?",22,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Totally. Plus free mug.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.",25,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,11,She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!,11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,That time I did say &quot;Grinch.&quot;,6,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,11,"All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.",61,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?",16,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive &quot;no cigars in the apartment rule.&quot; God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. <em>.</em> High five.",22,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.,11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... <em></em>",80,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,Lily!,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Merry Christmas, assface.",3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,At my apartment.,3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?,13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.",27,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.,18,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,She hung up.,3,<strong><em>Ted to Robin</em></strong>

2,11,Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!,11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.,15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Where are you going?,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>

2,11,"Hey, dude, how's the paper going?",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?",10,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,Oh... so magical.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?",18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Sure does. Look, I gotta go.",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!",19,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means &quot;More Christ&quot; to our Spanish friends.",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.",26,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

2,11,"Oh, God, she called you?",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?,13,<strong><em>His mother</em></strong>
2,11,"No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?",8,<strong><em>Clint</em></strong>

2,11,You just look like a regular guy.,7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,And isn't it more comfy?,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,Yes.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,"Come on, you need eat something.",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,Too weak... to hold... bowl.,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,11,"Fine, I'll feed you.",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.,12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

2,11,You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?",27,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.",7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.",44,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.",22,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>

2,11,"I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?,16,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!",32,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.",8,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,You were a Grinch!,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

2,11,Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.,30,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.",13,<strong><em>Robin (on the phone)</em></strong>
2,11,"Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.",34,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Well, do you want me to go with you?",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,Was that a sincere offer?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,First tell me your answer.,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,"Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?",15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.",20,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,11,You're gonna be a great mom.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.",17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,Merry Christmas! What's in the box?,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.,18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,I thought you were writing a paper.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...",46,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.",28,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.",21,<strong><em>Women</em></strong>
2,11,"What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...",16,<strong><em>Women</em></strong>
2,11,"Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?",24,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.,11,<strong><em>Truck driver</em></strong>
2,11,My bad.,2,<strong><em>Truck driver</em></strong>
2,11,"I'm okay. <strong><em></em></strong> Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.",13,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.,16,<strong><em>Truck driver</em></strong>
2,11,"Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?",14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Sadly, no.",2,<strong><em>Truck driver</em></strong>
2,11,"We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.",25,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?",33,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.,23,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Wow, that's a great gift.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...",18,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.",39,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Dude... how was the concert?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,I couldn't find the outside.,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.,9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?",10,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,Staten Island.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Why?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,11,"Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Like the gift of God's love?,6,<strong><em>A kid</em></strong>
2,11,"No, dude, real presents.",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Uncle Ted got us presents!,5,<strong><em>Kid</em></strong>
2,11,"That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.",9,<strong><em>Stacy</em></strong>
2,11,Yay!,1,<strong><em>Charity</em></strong>
2,11,"Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?",18,Stacy
2,11,"Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.",16,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.,9,<strong><em>Charity</em></strong>
2,11,"That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. <em>Doorbell rings.</em> Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.",45,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.",16,<strong><em>Charity</em></strong>
2,11,"Who is it, Ted?",4,<strong><em>Stacy</em></strong>
2,11,"Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. <em>Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.</em>",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.,14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Are you coming home?,4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.",9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Yes,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?,12,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,"Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.",14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.,8,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,11,Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,11,"Mom, what's a Grinch?",4,<strong><em>Kid</em></strong>

2,12,That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.,25,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

2,12,"Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.",13,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,"Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.",16,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.,10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,"Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.",21,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,"Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.",15,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,"No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.",37,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,"So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.",20,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,12,"Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;",31,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,"So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.",34,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.",24,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.,16,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.",22,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>

2,12,"Hello, Kitty.",2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,"Oh, no. No. No. No.",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>

2,12,"Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.",6,<strong><em>Katie</em></strong>
2,12,Looks like hotness runs in the family.,7,<strong><em>Kyle</em></strong>
2,12,"Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?",12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,Two whole months.,3,<strong><em>Katie</em></strong>
2,12,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Kyle</em></strong>
2,12,"He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?",13,<strong><em>Katie</em></strong>
2,12,"My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...",14,<strong><em>Kyle</em></strong>

2,12,What? Oh. Oh...,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.,32,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,"Yeah, I don't have any of those.",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,12,Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.,17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,It's 2,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,That's why I need your help.,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.",22,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,12,You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun,14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,12,"When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.",53,fact number one

2,12,Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.,26,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,"Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.",24,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,You told them?,3,<strong><em>Katie</em></strong>
2,12,"Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?",26,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,Totally. You should wait.,4,<strong><em>All</em></strong>
2,12,</strong>s*x is fun.,3,<strong>Barney
2,12,See?,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.,13,<strong><em>Katie</em></strong>
2,12,"Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,"Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...",23,<strong><em>Katie</em></strong>

2,12,"Oh, remember cloves?",3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,No!,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,"No &quot;Aw, remember cloves?&quot; This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.",26,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,12,We were 18.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

2,12,What camp?,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.,15,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,What did you teach?,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,"Uh, dance.",2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,Dance?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,12,"Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.",32,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

2,12,"Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.",21,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.,17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,"Yeah, New Year's Eve.",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,Okay.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,"Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.",12,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,That's not a good idea.,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

2,12,"You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.",19,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,12,What do you mean just barely?,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,12,"Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>

2,12,"No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,Who's Scooter?,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,12,"My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.",11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>

2,12,It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,12,"No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.",47,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>

2,13,"Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?",20,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,I know what you're thinking,5,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,Stairs?,1,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.",37,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.,20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.",15,Co-worker
2,13,But suddenly I was a different guy.,7,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Hey, guys. What's so funny?",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Nothing. Um... nice shirt.,4,<strong><em>Co-worker</em></strong>
2,13,Thanks.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.,14,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.",12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Before, I used to be this guy.",7,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.",18,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,But now...I was this guy.,5,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... &quot;Foo Fighters.&quot; Get back to work.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"But still, the worst part was Druthers.",7,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, I was thinking...",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.",23,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.",7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,Why would you say that?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.",13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,I have found that to be true.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,It's a blessing and a curse really.,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

2,13,"So, what are you gonna do?",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.",21,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Fire him.,2,<strong><em>MP</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.",14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.",24,<strong><em>MP</em></strong>
2,13,"Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.",17,<strong><em>MP</em></strong>
2,13,You mind if I charge my phone?,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Knock yourself out.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?",20,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... <strong><em>(Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.)</em></strong>",42,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.,12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, my God! <em>(barney's holding a painting)</em>",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Do you know about this?,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,No.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,What is that?,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.",37,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.",9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.",19,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, come on, Robin.",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,I know! We're gonna have so much fun!,8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?",15,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.",14,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.",28,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Happy birthday to you.,4,<strong><em>Employees</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, you had me. You so had me.",8,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"So, you didn't fire him?",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.",24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.",13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"And, uh... I... got you a rose.",7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.,11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.",9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, wow, a new dart.",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Hey, that new dart is great.",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.",13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,</em> Nude art.,3,<em>Ted
2,13,</em> Nude art.,3,<em>Robin
2,13,"Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?",11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,I knew this day would come.,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,How did you know that?,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,Because I didn't hide it very well.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.",27,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.",16,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.",14,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!,14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"No, he's actually a little husky...",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.",23,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, just forget it.",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.",15,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, then you'll have to do it.",7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.,21,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,We totally saw your butt.,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.,13,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Where is it?,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.,12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?",9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Field trip!,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.",15,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?",5,<strong><em>Carl</em></strong>
2,13,"What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!",20,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.",9,<strong><em>Carl</em></strong>
2,13,I know that Barney gave you that painting.,8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,I don't know what you're talking about.,7,<strong><em>Carl</em></strong>
2,13,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,I doubt it.,3,<strong><em>Carl</em></strong>
2,13,"Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.",11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,I doubt it.,3,<strong><em>Carl</em></strong>
2,13,"All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.",13,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,I doubt it.,3,<strong><em>Carl</em></strong>
2,13,This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.,11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?",26,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...",25,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"One</em></strong> of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.",31,<strong><em>Ted
2,13,"Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.",8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,"You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.",13,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Are you serious?,3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?",14,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Paint me.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,What?,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Paint me.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Who's that? Who's out there?,5,<strong><em>Voice</em></strong>
2,13,"Hammond, is that you?",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Mosby?,1,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.",23,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Uh, look, just a second, Ted.",6,<strong><em>Mr Druters</em></strong>
2,13,"Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?",22,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,What</em></strong> are you doing?,4,<strong><em>Mr Druthers
2,13,I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?,12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.",30,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...",21,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.,10,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,It's okay.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,What did you want to say to me?,8,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?,14,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah, I do.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Cause I design homes.,4,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,I see it.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,But I don't have a home.,6,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.",36,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?",39,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Uh, no, I don't.",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.",12,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, that's the dream.",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.",7,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Me too, Hammond.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Call me Ham.,3,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"No, thanks.",2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,Hammy D?,2,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"No, I think just Hammond.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.",7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,13,I was this close.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.",13,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh honey, you're awake?",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,I'm awake. Is everything okay?,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?,22,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.",11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?",16,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.",41,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?",26,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Loch Ness?,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...",10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.",22,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,Maybe we can.,3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Paint me.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?",23,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.",29,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.",44,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.,15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"I'll give you $5,000.",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,We're going to Loch Ness!,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,Yeah!,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,That cabby would not shut up.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah, we should call him a gabby.",7,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"I think it, you say it.",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Hey</em></strong>, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.",13,<strong><em>Mr Druthers
2,13,"Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.",15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it",21,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...",6,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,Can I see you for one second?,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Ooh, I'm in trouble now.",5,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.",24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.,12,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,13,"Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.",25,<strong><em>Mr Druthers</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, let's get this over with.",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.",29,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,Thank you.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, &quot;There's stands Barnabus Stinson.&quot; He was wise... and strong.",40,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,I don't think your sword will fit.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,I get that a lot.,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.",20,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,This isn't right. This isn't right at all.,8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,13,"Finally, he could take it no more.",7,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,13,Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,Paint faster!,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,13,"Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.",8,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,13,"Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...",16,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

2,15,"You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. <em></em> Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?",41,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,15,That thing better have call waiting.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?,10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?,40,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?",15,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.,16,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, man, it kills.",4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"You want some aspirin, baby?",5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,You know I don't believe in pain killers.,8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole &quot;Unbreakable&quot; theory.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,Marshall used to think he was indestructible.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.",32,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,There was a really heavy door. He opened it.,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,On one pull.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.",17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,Training for a marathon.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,What?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.,12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"You're kidding, right?",3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.,12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?",21,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,Absolutely.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.",16,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,,0,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",18,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.",13,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,"Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.",24,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Ooh, he's starting!",3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,This ought to be good. Wow. <em>(48 minutes later)</em> He's already passing the second checkpoint.,15,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.",14,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.",9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf,&quot; and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?",37,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, it looks like, &quot;Barney&quot; should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.",31,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,It's really him.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!",7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,"What up, non-finishers?",3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"Wow. Very impressive, Barney.",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.",38,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.,10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,So where's my 50 bucks?,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"All right. I got to admit, you earned this.",9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.",20,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.",18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,Wow. You know I really should check out this &quot;subway.&quot; Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.,38,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,You're dating a girl from New Jersey?,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,No.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.,20,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,Hello?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.",18,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"What, what are you talking about?",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.",9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,86th street.,2,<strong><em>Voice</em></strong>
2,15,"My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.",31,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,<em></em> Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.,21,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,Best 50 bucks I ever spent.,6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?",41,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Ted, Ted.",2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?",14,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,15,I'm sorry. I can't.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,Douche.,1,<strong><em>Old lady</em></strong>
2,15,Barney?!,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,Ted!,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,Hey!,1,<strong><em>Policeman</em></strong>
2,15,No...!,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,"See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.",31,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.,24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,So I was able to get you two seats.,9,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,15,Really? That's great!,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?",19,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,15,"Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?",9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.,11,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,15,"What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, he never even called you back?",7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.",28,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,15,"It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.",35,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,What was the name of the airline again?,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,I think it was something like Flights R' Us.,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,Was the &quot;R&quot; backwards?,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"God, I hope not.",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,Geez.,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.",14,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,My pants are starting to feel a little tight.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,I cannot allow this.,4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,What?,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,I am going to run the New York City Marathon.,10,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"&quot;It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice.&quot; Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.",39,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,"Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.",28,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,&quot;Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.&quot;,9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!,38,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"&quot;Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.&quot;",27,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.",31,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Marshall? Oh, my God!",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! <em></em> And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.",65,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on,11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Hey, what's going on here?",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Yeah, but for what?",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. &quot;Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8",31,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?",17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,We have to camp out.,5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,Are you serious?,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.",29,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,</strong> I can't go. I've got this thing.,8,<strong>Barney
2,15,What thing?,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,A pen1s.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,15,This is the place.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?",21,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,You said wang.,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,"You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.",11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,That's kind of annoying.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (<em>5 hours later)</em> I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?",52,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,"It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?",21,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.",13,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.,13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Morning, ladies.",2,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,It's him. It's the car guy!,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,15,Get out of here!,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...",35,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,Nobody does it better than you.,6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,15,"Marshall?! Oh, my God! <em></em>",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.",19,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.",21,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.",10,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,"Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,You did that story on the giant pizzas?,8,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,Would you check to see if you have any more seats?,11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?",11,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,Robin...,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"</strong> One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",17,<strong>Robin
2,15,</strong> I knew it!,4,<strong>Man
2,15,"God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.",29,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.",21,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?,15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.,10,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,"Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?",17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?,17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,1939?! This penny's from 1939! <em></em> A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?,20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.",11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"No, it's not.",3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.",22,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,And that's exactly what I did.,6,<strong><em>Ted( voix off)</em></strong>
2,15,You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.,13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.",14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,How dare you.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Hey, what's going on?",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Yeah, but for what?",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.",26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.",30,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...",24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.,25,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Uh, sir?",2,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,"Oh, please tell me you have some good news.",9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.",14,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,15,"All, right, well, thanks for trying.",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,15,"Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.",22,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,15,"But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York.

2,16,"No! Seriously, stop!",3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion...",13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion.",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,What are you talking about? It's yours.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"No, it's not.",3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"No, it's not.",3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Um, my sister's.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"So, in other words, some girl you went out with.",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Um... I love you.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?,14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.,10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.,10,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much.",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Why is that still in your apartment?,7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,I don't know. I just never threw it out.,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?",11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.",25,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Not three dollars! Try 14.,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Why is this such a big deal?,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!,9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Whoa, she wasn't a whore.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?",26,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"No. No! No! Oh, Ted!",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Ah, the age-old question",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.",13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.,10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.",12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"Nice, right?",2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old,11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Yes!,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,I vote they can stay. &quot;Check out the jackass in the parachute pants&quot; is a <strong><em>good icebreaker.</em></strong>,17,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Ted. Ted? Ted?,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Sorry, buddy, it's a &quot;no&quot; for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.",24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.,12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.",18,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.",11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.",95,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.",9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.",19,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?,16,<strong><em>Ex-girlfriend 1</em></strong>
2,16,He calls you &quot;sweetie pie&quot;? He called me &quot;sweetie pie.&quot;,10,<strong><em>Ex-girlfriend 2</em></strong>
2,16,"I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.",9,<strong><em>Ex-girlfriend 3</em></strong>
2,16,Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!,13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,You're creepy and gross.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Your mom's creepy and gross.,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.",24,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.,23,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.",9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,I side with Robin.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.",13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?",23,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Just stop, sweetie.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.",62,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,"Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?",19,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Where do you guys want to sit?,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,I know where I don't want to sit.,8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"Guys, four together!",3,<strong><em>Marshall (in the front row)</em></strong>
2,16,I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.,10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,No? Okay.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,I... am... Rage!,3,<strong><em>Man 1</em></strong>
2,16,I... am Greed.,3,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,16,I am Rage... Envy!,4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,I am outta here.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"No, you're not. You have to stay.",7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,This is the face of Consumerism!,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.",8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!",10,<strong><em>Man 2</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, baby, that was wonderful!",5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.",9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, &quot;Now we are really cookin'!&quot;",17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Wow, Lily, that sucked!",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Barney!,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.",23,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.",23,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah, if you're a Smurf.",5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.",22,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, really? You would?",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Yes.,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.",5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,We'll be starting our Q&amp;A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. <em>Barney runs out</em>,18,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,16,Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?,9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,I know. He can be really insensitive.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"It was pretty bad, though.",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, my God, it was so bad.",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, my God, you've been robbed!",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Nope.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?,13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,What can I say? Papa gets swag.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...,12,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,"You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.",26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?",22,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Nope. Well, except for my dogs.",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right",32,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"What's your point, Ted?",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?",20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,I do now.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,That's ridiculous.,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,You said everything.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,But not living things.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Things with a heartbeat can stay.,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Enjoying this?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.",9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.,19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Guess what position we did it in.,7,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,16,"Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Um, no.",2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.",16,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,She's not getting rid of the dogs.,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,What's the matter with you?,5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,Even I wouldn't do that.,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Yes!,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.",20,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,I miss Jebediah.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.",9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Very funny.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.",32,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, we'll be there.",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...",12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,Never.,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.,11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.,13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,So we're-we're okay?,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah, we're great.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.",23,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, yeah, that's the spot.",5,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,16,"Dude, I gotta pee.",4,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,16,I gotta go.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.",25,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,You're gonna kill your dogs?!,5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.",15,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.",23,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.",21,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,&quot;They&quot;? What do you mean by &quot;they&quot;?,7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!",10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...",16,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,"I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.",27,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.,9,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,Moist.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.,9,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.,14,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,I never get picked for audience participation.,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,16,And then it just got weird.,6,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,"Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,And when that didn't work...,5,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,"Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?",13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.",20,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,"Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting",16,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.",10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.,25,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah, well, anyway.",3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,16,Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert,11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,16,"So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.",20,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,Hey.,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Where've you been? I called you earlier.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,I gave my dogs away to my aunt.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,You what?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.",17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Wow. Oh, man.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Can we go inside?,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,Why? What's going on inside?,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Um, the floors are gone.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,What?,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,You said you threw all that stuff away!,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,"Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.",73,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,16,We're really doing this?,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,16,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,16,We're moving in together!,4,<strong><em>Ted and Robin</em></strong>

2,17,"Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry.

2,17,Hey. One good thing,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.,29,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

2,17,"Hey <em></em> I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.",45,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...",36,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.",16,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,She'd be so bummed if I left early.,8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,I hear you.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?",30,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.,11,<strong><em>Ted(voix off)</em></strong>
2,17,So... this song.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.",30,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.,8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Don't worry. It comes around again.,6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,What do you mean?,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door...",15,<strong><em>Ted and Marshall singing</em></strong>
2,17,"Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.",6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,What?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, &quot;Zitch dog.&quot; I'm pretty good, so...",26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Zitch dog.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Zitch dog.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Zitch dog. Damn it!,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,12-nothing.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Marshall. Marshall.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Zitch dog, blue Suburban.",4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Damn it!,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,18-nothing.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.",14,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,17,Where the hell are we?!,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.",12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Really? Seems impossible.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.",23,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Doesn't seem like a smart idea.,6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.,12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"No, keep driving.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.",15,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.",28,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Nah, I threw them out.",5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,What?!,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,No food or drink in the Fiero.,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... <strong><em></em></strong>,14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.,8,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.",35,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.",17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.,13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.",13,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Wasn't an easy decision.,4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,This is all because of your insane no-food rule.,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,It's perfectly rational.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?",21,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(<em>they're both in the back seat in each other arms</em>) We should've kept driving.,36,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Come on, Marshall.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.",44,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Yeah?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Are you still thinking about Lily?,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Please stop.<strong><em></em></strong> And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...,22,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.,8,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,17,Zitch dog!,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Damn it!,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.,14,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"With privileges, from the sound of it.",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Eriksen. <em></em>,2,<strong><em>Mechanic</em></strong>
2,17,Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.",20,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Well, it's a pretty old car.",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.",15,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.",36,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,How dare you...,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Hey.,1,<strong><em>Robibn</em></strong>
2,17,I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.,11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Hitchhiking Waldo. <em></em>The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.,18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; on me.",12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.",12,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,"Guys, what are you talking about?",6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.",18,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.,11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.",14,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,"But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.",13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. <strong><em>(</em></strong><em>Lily slows down the car and knock down the food).</em> Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; are the only two things he's really serious about.",79,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,"Lily, it's gonna be fine.",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!",18,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,"Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.",65,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.",11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,"Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.",12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,These cigars aren't helping at all.,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,Yeah. This was a terrible idea.,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. <em>End of flasback.</em>,15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,The broken windows?,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,We had to make it look realistic.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,Why did you break two of them?,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.,13,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.,17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.",16,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,"Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?",15,<strong><em>Mechanic</em></strong>
2,17,I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.",14,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!,11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,What? Why?,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,Why? Why? Why?! Why?!,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.,12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Hey.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.,13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,To Queens?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.",8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.",8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Wait! You know how to drive, right?",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.",33,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Which pedal's the gas?,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Trick question.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"No, it's not",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Yes, it is.",3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"No, it's not.",3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.",20,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.,14,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.,15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Dude, a dog.",3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.,10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Which? Which one's the break again?,6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,The left one.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Make the Ls,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Oh, we're not going to make it.",7,.<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Why did you just turn on the radio?,8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Relax. You're being crazy.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,"Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.,13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,We're okay.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.,10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,17,"Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.",49,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.,13,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,True story.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.,26,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Yes!,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted and Robin</em></strong>
2,17,It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>,12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.",110,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.,10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,17,I would like to say good-bye. <em>Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.</em>,26,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,Affected.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,That's what I said.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,17,"Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. <em>Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.</em>",59,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.",13,<strong><em>Maechanic</em></strong>
2,17,Close enough!,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Close enough!,2,<strong><em>All</em></strong>
2,17,"And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.",33,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,17,"Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>",10,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,"Rot in hell, devil steed.",5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,17,And what better friend is there than that?,8,<strong><em>Ted (voix off)</em></strong>
2,17,Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.,12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,17,Put it in.,3,<strong><em>Brother</em></strong>

2,20,"Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,That's fantastic.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.",42,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, crap.",2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, crap.",2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.",28,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,That grandpa died three years ago.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.",23,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"So which one, &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;?",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,What was that?,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, &quot;Barney Stinson, come on down!&quot;",18,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Yeah, of course.",3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.",24,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?",39,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,What happened?,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,"She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.",24,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?",32,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,"Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate souffl√©e with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.",17,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.,10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,Done!,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.",26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,",5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,Nice.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4,25,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,I love you.,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.",17,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,Yeah. <em>Ted leaves the room.</em>,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family,14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?",15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said &quot;I love you&quot; to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns",45,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.",20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Hey, Lil.",2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,Hey.,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,Hey? That's it?,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,What are you talking about?,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do",30,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.",29,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>
2,20,"Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? <em></em>",23,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, wow, that was pretty close.",6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!",37,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?",11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.",33,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Your father?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Your dad... is Bob Barker?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,That's right,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,That's Pops.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Barney?,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,"Yes, Robin?",2,<strong><em>Bareney</em></strong>
2,20,Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?,12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,"Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?",17,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, I don't know. That guy<em>. </em>",7,<strong><em>Barney's mom</em></strong>
2,20,"</em>Look, Dad, I got straight A's!",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong><em>(in front oft he tv<strong>)</strong>
2,20,"Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?",9,<strong><em>Bareny</em></strong> <em>(dressed as Bob Barker)</em>
2,20,"Want to play some catch, Pop?",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong> (throwing a ball at the TV)
2,20,"So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.",27,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?,12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,Why is this so hard for you people to believe?,10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.",25,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,This is the best wedding diet ever.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,I lost a pound.,4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.,11,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.,11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!",40,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,I can't.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,I'm trying.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,Okay!,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,Finally.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.",9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Still strong, right?",3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Man, I'm well nourished right now!",6,<strong><em>Ted (last year)</em></strong>
2,20,Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.,6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.",12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,20,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.",12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.,35,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?,17,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. <em>End flashback.</em> It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.",23,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.",11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.",28,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.",24,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,I know.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.",85,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Marshall, what are you doing?",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,Going to the bathroom.,4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,In the hall?,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,Sleepwalking?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,You're wide awake.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,Robbing us?,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,Dude.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily.",17,<strong><em>Ted (giving the toast)</em></strong>
2,20,"God, I missed you.",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?",16,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Sure, baby.",2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,How's the weight gaining going?,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,20,"Well, I'm here now.",4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,20,"And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.",70,<strong><em>Ted(giving the toast)</em></strong>
2,20,To Lily and Marshall.,4,<strong><em>All</em></strong>
2,20,"Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.",40,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>
2,20,"Rich, what is the name of our next participant?",9,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.",16,<strong><em>Rich</em></strong>
2,20,"Nooo. Oh, my God!",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here.",13,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>

2,20,"And Barney, what do you bid on that?",8,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.",18,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"$1,350 for Barney.",3,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"So, was it $1,350?",4,Lily</em></strong>
2,20,I don't know. Was it?,5,Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Happy wedding.,2,Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.",15,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"Thank you, Bob.",3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.",48,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,$1 billion.,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

2,20,"Yes, Barney. This is...",4,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,What are you doing?,4,Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Uh, spending some quality time with my dad.",8,Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.",17,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.",11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

2,20,"Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.",6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around...",17,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>

2,20,"Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?",11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Sure.,1,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,That was kind of a weird moment.,7,Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?",25,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.",8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?",14,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>

2,20,"$14,628.",1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"$14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...",39,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,"Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.",26,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,"Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...",6,<strong><em>Bob</em></strong>
2,20,Have your pets spayed or neutered.,6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Why didn't you tell him?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.",32,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,20,"Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!",8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,20,And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.,18,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>

2,21,"Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.,8,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.",34,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.,27,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?,12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, &quot;I do.&quot; Yeah.",22,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.",13,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>
2,21,Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.,17,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.",16,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?",8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.,12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.",47,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.",25,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross &quot;harp player&quot; off my list.,15,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,How long is this list?,5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.",14,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.",7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Sweet! I can cross off two things.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.,15,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>
2,21,"Hi, Lily.",2,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>
2,21,Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>

2,21,"Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.",12,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>
2,21,You only play half the harp?,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?",23,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,I've been studying the harp for 12 years.,8,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>
2,21,"Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;? Learned that in a day. Is there a &quot;Harp Hero&quot;?",22,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?",9,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Tuesday.,1,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>

2,21,Last Tuesday.,2,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>
2,21,"Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, &quot;Oh, my wedding has to be perfect.&quot; Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.",39,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.,10,<strong><em>Barman</em></strong>
2,21,"Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.",9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.",7,<strong><em>Barman</em></strong>
2,21,"You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.",11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

2,21,Really? That didn't work.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Bill?,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.,10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?,18,<strong><em>Bill</em></strong>
2,21,Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?",17,<strong><em>Bill</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?",16,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,He kind of did.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,That's Scooter.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.,11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Why? Why would she do that?,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.",29,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I'll get it.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.,11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Me, too. I was up all night.",7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Hello, Lily.",2,<strong><em>Scooter</em></strong>
2,21,"Hey, Bill.",2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Hey, Barney.",2,<strong><em>Scooter</em></strong>
2,21,"Scooter, what are you doing here?",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"It's not &quot;Scooter&quot; anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.",30,<strong><em>Scooter</em></strong>
2,21,"You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?",6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I want... I want... Scooter!,5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I need a glass of wine.,6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,And I need you to get out of my face.,10,<strong><em>Barman</em></strong>
2,21,"It's for the bride, so...",5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,You got it.,3,<strong><em>Barman</em></strong>
2,21,She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.,8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.",17,<strong><em>Barman</em></strong>
2,21,"Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...<em>The barman leaves</em>... Let the games begin.",16,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from &quot;November Rain.&quot; By W. Axl Rose.",24,<strong><em>Scooter</em></strong>
2,21,That is a good song.,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?,11,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,What's up with Bill?,4,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,That's Scooter.,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,I'm on it.,3,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,Hey.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Hey.,1,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,21,Can I have your phone number?,6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,No.,1,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,21,It's for the bride.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.,9,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,21,The bride wants you to walk slower.,7,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, wow.",2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I have hairy nipples.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,Really?,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"No, but it worked, didn't it?",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.",28,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,"There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...",12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.,18,<strong><em>Woman</em></strong>
2,21,I'm okay.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.",16,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,21,I'm fine.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Just FYI,2,<strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>
2,21,Totally cool.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.",18,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.",11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Are you sure?,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.",64,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Lily, are you okay?",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!,21,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,What happened to &quot;I don't want a perfect wedding&quot;?,9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.",35,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.",21,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.",22,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",15,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Well, it's not too short.",5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!,18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,The good Backstreet Boys?,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,What-what the hell happened to you?,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.",22,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"So, um, just not-not too short, okay?",7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.",17,<strong><em>Cousin</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.",30,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.",9,<strong><em>Cousin</em></strong>
2,21,"I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.",18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,I can't get married like this! There's no way!,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Ah, let me see what I can do.",8,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,What? What can you do?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,I have a superpower.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.,17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,That's crazy. Of course she will.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,Would you marry me?,4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule,13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?",13,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?",42,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.",16,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!",43,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,What?!,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.,43,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Dude, those guys are criminals.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!",16,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,No!,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,Yes.,1,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,"Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.",23,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no!",2,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,"Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.",12,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,"Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? <em>(Ben's wearing a toupee)</em> Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.",24,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.,26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Boy, that's a pretty tall order.",6,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?,24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.",9,<strong><em>Ben</em></strong>
2,21,Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... <em>Barney comes and takes the toupee.</em>,27,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,The bride needs this.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Actually, I think it kinda works.",6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,It totally does.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,Barney?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.",13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?",14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.",14,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, you know...",3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,In a bad way.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Hey. Cool hair, bro.",4,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,What happened to your shirt?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.,10,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,You gonna put another shirt on?,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?",8,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Not for long, bro. Not for long.",7,<strong><em>Brad</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?",17,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.,17,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.",15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no.",2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, my God! Marshall...",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Lily, you're not supposed to see me.",7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,What happened? Did Amy do this to you?,8,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?",18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.",24,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Yeah, I know. I heard.",5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.",17,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,What? No &quot;Property of Marshall&quot; across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?,18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?",11,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I wish we could have that wedding.,7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,So do it.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,What?,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.",25,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something",12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?",14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.",22,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"What do you think, baby?",5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,I love it.,3,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.",12,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?",12,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Okay.,1,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,21,Thank you.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.,13,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.",38,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,He's gonna cry.,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?",39,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"Oh, no. I don't have my vows.",7,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,I don't have mine either.,5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.,12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called &quot;Eggs Marshall,&quot; and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.",89,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,No problem.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,21,It's totally okay.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,"My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, &quot;Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96.&quot; I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.",77,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Hey, I found your panties!",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,I'm good.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?",18,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Slow down.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?,14,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,I do.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?",17,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,I do.,2,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.",36,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,21,Did you smoke?,3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,No.,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,21,"After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.",51,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>
2,21,How do you feel?,4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,Tired. I got married twice today.,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,"So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?",24,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,21,"What do you think? Bathroom, of course.",7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,21,Please don't.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

2,22,"Well, technically two.",3,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,No! They cleared our plates again!,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,"Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.",21,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, you still have me.",5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,Yeah...,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.",32,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...",14,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,Are those mini quiches? (<em>Marshall and Lily run</em>) Tell the secret.,11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?",34,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.",12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.,12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Champagne?,1,<strong><em>Waiter</em></strong>
2,22,"Um, we didn't order champagne.",5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Compliments of the house.,4,<strong><em>Waiter</em></strong>
2,22,Wow. Thanks. Cheers.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...",11,<strong><em>Robin (voive over)</em></strong>
2,22,Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.,5,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(<em>Lily and Marshall leave</em>) So what was in the glass?",36,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, &quot;Champagne?&quot; &quot;We didn't order any champagne.&quot; &quot;Compliments of the house.&quot; &quot;Wow.&quot;",24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,You said that already!,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...",13,<strong><em>Ted (voice over)</em></strong>
2,22,Is an engagement ring.,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?,10,<strong><em>Man( with a camera)</em></strong>
2,22,Don't get married.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Why don't I come back.,5,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,"An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do",13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,That's what she said.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no.",16,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,What are you talking about?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.",25,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,That's not mine.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,What?,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,That's not mine.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Then whose is it?,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,It's mine. Janna... will you marry me?,7,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,Yes.,1,<strong><em>Janna</em></strong>
2,22,Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.,9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,What the hell was that?,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,What the hell was what?,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,That reaction?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,I thought you were proposing to me.,7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.,15,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.",8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Now more than ever.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?",8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,No.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Then why is this an issue?,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, &quot;No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. &quot;Ted, you cannot do this to me. &quot;No. No, no, no.&quot;",55,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?",20,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,No.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.",11,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,So did you guys find anything to eat?,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,I had four strawberries.,4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?,11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Yes.,1,<strong><em>Lily (burping)</em></strong>
2,22,"Lily, you could have burped or said the word &quot;Yes,&quot; but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.",23,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, look, more strawberries!",4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,So what happened next?,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Ted, don't do this.",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Where do you see yourself?,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married.",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,And I probably want to be in Argentina.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Argentina?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.",31,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"We have an expiration date, don't we?",7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.",15,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Barney... story's not over.,4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?,12,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...",13,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, my God, it's you.",5,<strong><em>Waiter</em></strong>
2,22,Wha... what?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.,12,<strong><em>Waiter</em></strong>
2,22,Run!,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Run? Your strategy was run?,5,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.,23,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Yeah? And how did that work out for you?,9,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.,20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?",8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!",26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,So... Argentina.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Argentina.,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there.",27,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,I could want to live in Argentina.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does.",26,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.",35,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina.",48,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, shut up.",3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,You're scared I might not be kidding.,7,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Aren't you?,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky.",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.",55,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Right? Right?,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,You caught the bouquet?,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Barney. The story's not over yet.,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,What?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,I don't know if I can do this to you.,10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Do what?,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids.",15,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black &quot;X&quot; over Argentina.",21,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,You know what I mean.,5,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.",40,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.",25,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted.",9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?",17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, we probably shouldn't.",4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,Risk it?,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Risk it.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,No.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.",19,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,"No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Come on, they're cutting the cake.",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clich√©e, remember?",23,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"No, it's going to be so funny.",7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,"Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. (<em>Lily's so drunk that she falls</em>)",19,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,Whoopsy-daisy.,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,"And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much.",22,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,We love you. I love you.,6,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
2,22,"Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.",13,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"God, this guy's giving me nothing.",6,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,"All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, &quot;What's up?&quot;",20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

2,22,"The story's not over, Barney.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Not a euphemism.,3,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.",10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister.",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.,15,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so...",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?",7,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,"We're not doing this, are we?",6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,I don't want to have kids in Argentina.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.,9,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,So where does that leave us?,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.,20,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,You stole a blue French horn for me.,8,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.,8,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,You did break up.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Yep.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,You're not pregnant?,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Nope.,1,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?,6,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...",17,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.,10,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
2,22,You guys okay?,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...",12,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,But we're okay.,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>

2,22,Hello!,1,<strong><em>Ranjit</em></strong>
2,22,"Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?",14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch.",26,<strong><em>Ranjit</em></strong>
2,22,"Um, no, we actually had something else in mind.",9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,Okay.,1,<strong><em>Ranjit</em></strong>

2,22,Welcome to Wienerburger.,3,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,"Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions.",18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?,6,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,"No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married.",9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,Wow. Congratulations.,2,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,Thank you.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"That's $7.80. Hey, dude.",4,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash.",16,<strong><em>Man</em></strong>
2,22,My wife...,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
2,22,"So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.",94,<strong><em>Ted (2030)</em></strong>
2,22,"I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.",27,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for &quot;the one&quot; again. The only time I want to hear you saying &quot;the one&quot; is if it's followed by the word &quot;hundredth.&quot; What up?",39,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,"No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?",24,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
2,22,"Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.",19,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
2,22,Yeah.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

3,2,G'day.,1,All
3,2,"Oh, here. Will you sign this thank you note?",9,<strong>[The Apartment - Lily/Marshall]</strong>Lily
3,2,Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box.,29,Marshall
3,2,"Wow, it's a really nice blender.",6,Lily
3,2,"Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it.",14,Marshall
3,2,I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong?,13,Lily
3,2,"Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were &quot;Cancel Vogue&quot;.",29,Marshall
3,2,How can you open my letter?,6,Lily
3,2,"That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.",28,Marshall
3,2,"Marshall, wait.  This was our first fight as a married couple.",11,Lily
3,2,"Oh, baby.",2,Marshall

3,2,"There were three of them, at least two guns... they took all our money.",14,Ted
3,2,Well. I only had traveler's checks.,6,Barney
3,2,"Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight.",8,Marshall
3,2,Yes?,1,Lily
3,2,"I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.",11,Marshall
3,2,"Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.",25,Lily
3,2,You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter?,14,Marshall
3,2,"Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.",22,Lily
3,2,Really?,1,Marshall
3,2,"Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again.",22,Lily

3,2,Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder.,10,Lily
3,2,"Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?",14,Marshall
3,2,I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?,19,Lily
3,2,You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,8,Marshall
3,2,Come on. Let's get out of here. This night's a disaster.,11,<strong>[South of Bronx - Ted/Barney/Colleen/Lindsay]</strong>Ted
3,2,What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,18,Barney
3,2,"&quot;Thank God, we're alive&quot; s*x.",5,Ted
3,2,"&quot;Thank God we're alive&quot; s*x. It's even better than &quot;I can't believe you just proposed to me&quot; s*x, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.",33,Barney
3,2,All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.,14,Ted
3,2,Whew.,1,Ted
3,2,Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover.,14,Lindsay

3,2,"Oh, no. Oh, no.",4,Ted
3,2,"Oh, no.",2,Barney
3,2,New Jersey is not &quot;pretty much New York&quot;. You are not &quot;pretty much new yorkers&quot;.,15,Ted
3,2,And how would you know?,5,Colleen
3,2,"Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to &quot;pretty much New York&quot;? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",114,Ted

3,3,Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.,13,Marshall

3,3,"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?",10,Ted
3,3,"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?",32,Barney

3,3,"I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?",7,Rachel

3,3,"No, but fifty will.",4,Waitress
3,3,"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars.",9,Barney
3,3,We're combing upsars? What does that mean?,7,Marshall
3,3,He's coming upstairs!,3,Lily
3,3,Where are my pants? Where's my pants!,7,Marshall
3,3,Got 'em.,2,Ted
3,3,"Ooh, nice place!",3,Rachel
3,3,"Hey, are these your roommates?",5,Rachel
3,3,"Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.",24,Ted
3,3,You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.,12,Rachel
3,3,That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.,18,Ted
3,3,"OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble.",8,Rachel
3,3,Of course we can't promise anything.,6,Trudy
3,3,This is gonna be awesome.,5,Ted
3,3,No!,1,Ted
3,3,"What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",10,Ted
3,3,"We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",13,Lily
3,3,"Yeah bro, up top.",4,Marshall
3,3,"Oh, don't be gross.",4,Lily
3,3,"You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",15,Ted
3,3,"No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",20,Marshall
3,3,"Oh, you can use our bedroom.",6,Lily
3,3,"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",12,Ted
3,3,What are you doing?,4,Ted
3,3,I cannot allow Ted to do this.,7,Barney
3,3,"Why, why?",2,Ted
3,3,Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,29,Barney
3,3,"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",11,Marshall
3,3,"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",16,Barney
3,3,"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",13,Barney
3,3,"Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel.",22,Blonde Girl
3,3,OK.,1,Brunette Girl
3,3,I'll get the video camera.,5,Barney
3,3,Get out!,2,Blonde Girl
3,3,OK then.,2,Barney
3,3,Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,17,Ted
3,3,Tom Petty.,2,Marshall
3,3,Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,5,Ted
3,3,Where's Lily?,2,Ted
3,3,"Still looking for that CD, so...",6,Ted
3,3,What are you doing?,4,Ted
3,3,I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,14,Lily
3,3,I saw it first.,4,Lily
3,3,"You just made the list, bitch.",6,Lily
3,3,"I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",16,Lily
3,3,"Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",16,Ted
3,3,"No, never.",2,Lily
3,3,"What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",10,Ted
3,3,"Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",4,Lily
3,3,"OK, take it.",3,Ted
3,3,Wish me luck.,3,Ted
3,3,Oh my God.,3,Barney
3,3,Where's the shaving cream?,4,Robin
3,3,"Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.",8,Waitress
3,3,"Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",12,Robin
3,3,"Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?",9,Waitress
3,3,"Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",10,Robin
3,3,"Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.",16,Waitress
3,3,"Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap?",24,Robin's date
3,3,Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,19,Robin
3,3,Yeah.,1,Robin's date
3,3,You've gotta be kidding me.,5,Robin
3,3,Excuse me.,2,Robin
3,3,"So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",9,Ted
3,3,"That's OK, we don't need music to have fun.",9,Rachel
3,3,Exactly.,1,Ted
3,3,"You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?",9,Trudy
3,3,"It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",7,Ted
3,3,I'll get your coats? Ted,5,Lily
3,3,"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",6,Marshall
3,3,Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.,13,Barney
3,3,What are you talking about? Barney,6,Lily
3,3,"So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?",13,Blonde Girl
3,3,"Oh no, the night's ruined!",5,Barney
3,3,"No, baby, it's not.",4,Brunette Girl
3,3,Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,14,Barney
3,3,Why would you do that to yourself?,7,Marshall
3,3,"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",37,Barney
3,3,"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",13,Ted
3,3,"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.",28,Barney
3,3,It won't?,2,Ted
3,3,"No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",45,Barney
3,3,"Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.",10,Ted
3,3,Oh!,1,Rachel
3,3,"Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.",16,Ted
3,3,"Right, that's my apartment. Dressing gown's mine too. Damn, this should be me.",13,(back to present scene) Barney
3,3,I am so exhausted.,4,Rachel
3,3,So exhausted.,2,Trudy
3,3,Why would I want to tire them out?,8,Ted
3,3,That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,11,Barney
3,3,You give the most amazing foot massage.,7,Rachel
3,3,It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.,12,Ted
3,3,Why in God's name would I say that?,8,Ted
3,3,"It's endearing, you're a caregiver. Never take family values out of the equation.",13,(back to present scene in Ted's room) Barney
3,3,"Ted, what's wrong?",3,Trudy
3,3,I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.,15,Ted
3,3,"OK, what the hell.",4,Ted
3,3,"OK, wait for it.",4,Barney
3,3,"Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.",23,Ted
3,3,Oh my God.,3,Rachel
3,3,That's so true.,3,Trucy
3,3,Yeah.,1,Ted
3,3,"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",10,Ted
3,3,Yes you can.,3,Barney
3,3,"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.",15,Lily
3,3,All right.,2,Ted
3,3,I'll see you on the other side.,7,Ted
3,3,"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted",9,Barney
3,3,What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,17,Barney
3,3,"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",14,Barney
3,3,"You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!",14,Barney
3,3,"Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.",8,Ted
3,3,"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?",22,Barney
3,3,"Ted, belt.",2,Barney
3,3,Did you? Did you? Or didn't you?,7,(Barney lifts up belt) Barney
3,3,Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,9,Barney
3,3,Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK?,13,Robin's date
3,3,No problem.,2,Waitress
3,3,"No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open.",9,Waitress
3,3,"I guess I shouldn't be so surprised. I mean, she was acting weird all night, right? Waitress",17,Robins' date
3,3,Why don't I buy you a drink?,7,Waitress
3,3,OK.,1,Robin's date
3,3,Did I overhear that you're a surgeon?,7,Waitress
3,3,Guilty as charged.,3,Robin's date
3,3,You're so funny.,3,Waitress

3,4,What's his 'but'?,3,Ted
3,4,What do you mean? Ted,5,Lily
3,4,She's totally hot and really fun.,6,Barney
3,4,But she has a dead tooth.,6,Barney
3,4,She's superhot and she's so successful.,6,Marshall
3,4,But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.,12,Marshall
3,4,She's so cute and she's so smart.,7,Lily
3,4,But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.,23,Lily
3,4,"Wow, set it up.",4,Ted
3,4,I'm still convinced she killed my turtle.,7,Ted
3,4,"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",26,Robin
3,4,"If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!",14,Barney
3,4,"Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.",14,Lily
3,4,But? Lily,2,Ted
3,4,Oh.,1,Marshall
3,4,Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.,14,Ted
3,4,"But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.",14,Lily
3,4,Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.,5,Ted
3,4,I don't hate kids.,4,Robin
3,4,"You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.",12,Ted

3,4,I go to school all week. Can't I just have five minutes to myself to read Highlights and drink my juice?,21,Little Robin

3,4,The ultimate ice breaker.,4,Barney
3,4,"A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year.

3,4,Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?,32,Robin
3,4,A good one. He won full custody.,7,Lily
3,4,"He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?",13,Robin

3,4,Yes.,1,Marshall
3,4,Which one of us has more game?,7,Barney
3,4,"Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",15,Marshall
3,4,What? Marshall,2,Barney
3,4,"Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.",8,Ted
3,4,"You're joking. I have mad game, bra.",7,Marshall
3,4,"OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.",53,Barney
3,4,"I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.",10,Ted
3,4,What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,21,Marshall
3,4,"Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",22,Barney
3,4,Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?,9,Marshall
3,4,"First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.",34,Ted
3,4,Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,13,Marshall
3,4,"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",8,Barney
3,4,Fine.,1,Ted
3,4,There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,23,Barney
3,4,Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,16,Ted
3,4,That's good too.,3,Barney
3,4,How about her?,3,Barney
3,4,You're on.,2,Ted
3,4,"Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",13,Barney
3,4,"OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.",13,Ted
3,4,"One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.",27,Marshall
3,4,Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.,6,Ted
3,4,"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",10,Ted
3,4,I win.,2,Barney
3,4,How?,1,Ted
3,4,"Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",12,Barney
3,4,"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.",12,Ted
3,4,I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,9,Barney
3,4,"Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.",22,Ted
3,4,"Ted, she's leaving.",3,Marshall
3,4,Get out of my way.,5,Ted
3,4,"By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",11,Barney
3,4,Look who's got game.,4,Marshall
3,4,"You're a big kids person, huh?",6,George
3,4,"Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.",25,Robin
3,4,Babies.,1,George
3,4,"Yeah, I like that kind.",5,Robin
3,4,"Well, Doug's almost six",4,George
3,4,"Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to...  I hate kids.",19,Robin
3,4,"Excuse me, what? Robin",4,George
3,4,"What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?",29,George
3,4,"Yeah, let's take things slow.",5,Robin
3,4,"And, kids, that's exactly what she did.",7,Future Ted VO
3,4,"Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear.",21,Future Ted VO
3,4,"Hey, what's up?",3,Lily
3,4,"It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?",13,Robin
3,4,"Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.",9,Lily
3,4,Who are you? Robin,4,Doug
3,4,That's a bird's name.,4,Doug
3,4,No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.,9,Robin
3,4,"My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code?",16,Doug
3,4,"Dude, I'm just reading my paper.",6,Robin
3,4,"Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal?",14,Doug
3,4,Sure.,1,Robin
3,4,What are you doing? You're supposed to pour milk first? Robin,11,Doug
3,4,It tastes better milk first.,5,Doug
3,4,It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.,10,Robin
3,4,Why are you wearing my dad's pants?,7,Doug
3,4,Milk first it is.,4,Robin
3,4,What are you reading? Robin,5,Doug
3,4,Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.,10,Doug
3,4,"Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.",14,Robin
3,4,That's what I said. You're pretty cool.,7,Doug
3,4,You too.,2,Robin
3,4,"Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her.",33,Future Ted VO
3,4,"Well, have fun in yoga.",5,Ted
3,4,She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.,8,Ted
3,4,"Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.",7,Ted
3,4,You see this. Game face.,5,Ted
3,4,"Whatever, Ted.",2,Barney
3,4,"Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?",20,Ted
3,4,"Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.",22,Barney
3,4,"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it...",71,Marshall
3,4,Nice.,1,Barney
3,4,"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.",33,Marshall
3,4,Doesn't count.,2,Barney
3,4,Totally counts.,2,Marshall
3,4,"You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Marshall",16,Ted
3,4,"OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.",17,Barney
3,4,"Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.",8,Ted
3,4,"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted",40,Barney
3,4,"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on what I've already gone  on.",32,Barney
3,4,"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",9,Ted
3,4,"Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.",23,Barney
3,4,Fine.,1,Ted
3,4,And I only stirred that with my pinky.,8,Barney
3,4,"Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.",13,Robin
3,4,"Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.",10,Lily
3,4,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.",9,Robin
3,4,What?,1,Lily
3,4,"Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",34,Robin
3,4,What?,1,Robin
3,4,"I hate to tell you this but, too late.",9,Lily
3,4,He drew it in class today.,6,Lily
3,4,Oh crap.,2,Robin
3,4,"There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.",31,Robin
3,4,You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.,16,Lily
3,4,We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me,10,Robin
3,4,That's totally you.,3,Marshall
3,4,You guys are totally crazy.,5,Robin
3,4,"Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?",7,Ted
3,4,It's not me.,3,Robin
3,4,"You're joking, right?",3,Marshall
3,4,It's not me.,3,Robin
3,4,&quot;My new mommy.&quot; Kinda has a nice ring to it.,10,Ted
3,4,"Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",22,Marshall
3,4,Do guys really think this is me?,7,Robin
3,4,"Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",20,Lily
3,4,Really?,1,Robin
3,4,"Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.",23,Lily
3,4,"Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.",11,Robin
3,4,"So, I, I had a really nice time tonight.",9,Stacy
3,4,Me too.,2,Ted
3,4,Yeah?,1,Stacy
3,4,Mm-hm.,1,Ted
3,4,"Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first.",12,Little Barney
3,4,"From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there.",15,Little Barney
3,4,"Uh, Ted, something wrong?",4,Stacy
3,4,"Hey, Doug.",2,Robin
3,4,Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower.,11,Doug
3,4,"Actually, I came to see you.",6,Robin
3,4,"I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.?",8,Doug
3,4,"Sure, why not?",3,Robin
3,4,"To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies.",13,Doug
3,4,"Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",10,Robin
3,4,"Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",10,Robin
3,4,Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before.,14,Future Ted VO
3,4,"We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",51,Robin
3,4,"Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter.",15,Brooke
3,4,"I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie.",15,Brooke
3,4,What the hell was that? Doug,6,Robin
3,4,"So, this picture is not of me?",7,Robin
3,4,Why would I draw a picture of you?,8,Doug
3,4,How many dates has she been on with your dad?,10,Robin
3,4,Two.,1,Doug
3,4,"Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?",11,Robin
3,4,We just really connected.,4,Doug
3,4,And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.,16,Robin
3,4,"Why are you getting so upset, Roberta?",7,Doug
3,4,"Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?",9,Robin
3,4,Whatever.,1,Doug
3,4,"So, that's it, huh?",4,Robin
3,4,"Look, you're great, but...",4,Doug
3,4,"Yeah, there's always a 'but'.",5,Robin
3,4,"Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.",41,Ted
3,4,Which Chumbawumba song? Barney,4,Marshall
3,4,"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",16,Ted
3,4,That's what you think happened.,5,Barney
3,4,"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",12,Ted
3,4,Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,70,Barney
3,4,You are so sweet.,4,Stacy
3,4,"So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.",20,Barney
3,4,So you never slept with her?,6,Ted
3,4,Not even at all.,4,Barney
3,4,"Wow, that's good.",3,Marshall
3,4,It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?,7,Barney
3,4,"Well., have fun in yoga",5,Ted
3,4,Well?,1,Barney
3,4,Oh.,1,Barney
3,4,I'm sorry.,2,Stacy
3,4,"Stacy, right?",2,Barney
3,4,"Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?",8,Stacy
3,4,"Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?",11,Barney
3,4,I do.,2,Stacy
3,4,She plays bass in a reggae band.,7,(flashback to Ted telling Barney about Stacy) Ted
3,4,I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.,14,Barney
3,4,"Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.",9,Stacy
3,4,"No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.",19,Barney
3,4,After a while crocodile.,4,Ted
3,4,See you later alligator.,4,Barney
3,4,We are two peas.,4,Barney
3,4,"Wow, take care. Namaste.",4,Barney
3,4,You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.,9,Ted
3,4,"So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.",17,Barney
3,4,Translation,1,Barney
3,4,"No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...",7,Ted
3,4,"Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.",7,Barney
3,4,"Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.",13,Barney
3,4,I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.,9,Ted
3,4,I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.,9,Lily
3,4,"Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.",11,Robin
3,4,"Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours.",27,Future Ted VO
3,4,Hey.,1,Stacy
3,4,"You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.",14,Stacy
3,4,"That's what makes you so special, baby.",7,Barney
3,4,"Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy.",36,Stacy

3,5,"Everyone, this is Blah-blah.",4,Ted
3,5,Please call me Blah.,4,Blah-blah
3,5,"So, Blah, how did you two meet?",7,Marshall
3,5,"Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.",31,Blah-blah
3,5,It was so magical.,4,Ted
3,5,Except it wasn't.,3,Future Ted VO
3,5,She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.,16,Ted
3,5,"Ay, Chihuahua.",2,Marshall
3,5,What? There's no stigma anymore.,5,Ted
3,5,"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.",13,Robin
3,5,"So, she's hot.",3,Barney
3,5,"Oh, she's gorgeous.",3,Ted
3,5,Then she's crazy.,3,Barney
3,5,No she's not.,3,Ted
3,5,"Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.",16,Barney
3,5,"OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.",32,Ted
3,5,There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.,11,Barney
3,5,She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.,10,Ted
3,5,"Wait, hot-crazy scale?",3,Robin
3,5,Let me illustrate.,3,Barney
3,5,A girl is allowed to be crazy...,7,Barney
3,5,... as long as she is equally hot.,8,Barney
3,5,"Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",11,Barney
3,5,"If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",10,Barney
3,5,You want the girl to be above this line,9,Barney

3,5,...then lose ten pounds.,4,Barney

3,5,Starts with it too.,4,Marshall

3,5,It was late August 1996,5,Lily
3,5,Lily and I were both freshmen moving into,8,Marshall
3,5,Hewitt Hall.,2,Marshall
3,5,And she needed some help setting up her stereo.,9,Marshall VO

3,5,Ohhh.,1,Blah-blah

3,5,"Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today,  wanna tap that.",11,Marshall
3,5,"You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.",46,Blah-blah

3,5,Aw.,1,Everyone
3,5,"I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys.",10,Blah-blah

3,5,Shut up.,2,(Barney is about to say something) Ted
3,5,"So, we know how Marshall and Lily met. Robin, how did you and Barney meet?",15,(back from commercial break) Blah-blah
3,5,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.",22,Robin
3,5,Really? Sixteen no's. Really?,4,Barney
3,5,"So, you're single.",3,Blah-blah
3,5,Yeah.,1,Robin
3,5,"Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.",11,Blah-blah
3,5,"You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.",31,Ted
3,5,"Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich.",35,Future Ted VO
3,5,"Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich.",11,College Guy
3,5,Hey.,1,College Ted
3,5,"Good afternoon, sir. I'm Marshall Eriksen. College Ted",8,College Marshall
3,5,"OK, Dean Ted.",3,College Marshall
3,5,Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich.,6,College Ted
3,5,What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school.,27,College Marshall
3,5,"So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway.",12,College Ted
3,5,What do you mean?,4,College Marshall
3,5,I'm your new roommate. College Marshall,6,College Ted
3,5,I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.,11,Marshall
3,5,You're not the dean.,4,Marshall
3,5,"College, good times.",3,Robin
3,5,"Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.",22,Blah-blah
3,5,"Oh, here we go.",4,Barney
3,5,"Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.",18,Blah-blah
3,5,Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.,7,Barney
3,5,"These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?",13,Blah-blah
3,5,"Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?",17,Robin
3,5,"I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?",24,Blah-blah
3,5,"Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.",9,Robin
3,5,"Wow, that just came out of nowhere.",7,Blah-blah
3,5,"No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.",11,Robin
3,5,I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?,9,Blah-blah
3,5,"No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.",7,Robin
3,5,"Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.",20,Blah-blah
3,5,"You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.",20,Ted
3,5,"OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.",11,Barney
3,5,Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.,14,Barney
3,5,"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",5,Ted
3,5,"No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",45,Barney
3,5,"Oh man, I'm really sorry.",5,Ted
3,5,"Wow, you bought that?",4,Barney
3,5,What? Barney,2,Ted
3,5,Ted.,1,Ted
3,5,"Are you a total idiot, Ted?",6,Barney
3,5,"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney",8,Ted
3,5,I like you Ted.,4,Barney
3,5,"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",8,Barney
3,5,Barney. We met at the urinal.,6,Barney
3,5,"Oh right, hi.",3,Ted
3,5,"Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",11,Barney
3,5,I'm not wearing a suit.,5,Ted
3,5,"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",10,Barney
3,5,"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",22,Barney
3,5,"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",8,Barney
3,5,"Edward, this is Audrey.",4,Barney
3,5,"You know, I actually know some sign language.",8,Audrey
3,5,"Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you",9,Audrey
3,5,He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,12,Barney
3,5,I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,7,Ted
3,5,What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,10,Barney
3,5,My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,12,Ted
3,5,Here. Call me.,3,Audrey
3,5,"And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",24,Barney
3,5,"Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",14,Ted
3,5,He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,10,Ted
3,5,"Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",27,Barney
3,5,"Oh my God, you told them.",6,Blah-blah
3,5,"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",34,Ted
3,5,"Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",16,Barney
3,5,"Wait, you guys dated. For how long?",7,Blah-blah
3,5,"A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",53,Robin
3,5,"Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.",30,Blah-blah
3,5,"Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",7,Ted
3,5,"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",16,Barney
3,5,She started the night here,5,Barney
3,5,"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",29,Barney
3,5,Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.,16,Barney
3,5,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",16,Ted
3,5,"Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.",22,Blah-blah
3,5,"I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.",19,Blah-blah
3,5,Their story is not as magical as it seems.,9,Ted
3,5,What do you mean?,4,Blah-blah
3,5,"No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",8,Ted
3,5,"Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.",18,Blah-blah
3,5,"The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",10,Ted
3,5,"Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist.",11,College Ted
3,5,"Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220.",8,College Lily
3,5,"No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by.",9,College Ted
3,5,"Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.",5,College Lily
3,5,Chug chug chug chug,4,College students
3,5,"These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe.",17,College Ted
3,5,"Oh, it's fruity.",3,College Lily
3,5,"Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong.",11,College Ted
3,5,"So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?",7,College Lily
3,5,"Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, &quot;In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know.&quot; You know?",35,College Ted
3,5,Wow.,1,College Lily
3,5,"As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",29,Ted
3,5,Oh my God.,3,Blah-blah
3,5,"Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",20,Ted
3,5,You have to tell Marshall.,5,Blah-blah
3,5,"If he heard that, it would destroy him.",8,Ted
3,5,"If you don't tell him, I will.",7,Blah-blah
3,5,"Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",5,Ted
3,5,Oh no.,2,Ted
3,5,"So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.",14,Blah-blah
3,5,I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.,9,Ted
3,5,"Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",10,Lily
3,5,"I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says.",12,College Ted
3,5,"In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail.",53,College Ted
3,5,"Ted, this is Lily.",4,College Marshall
3,5,"No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen.",8,College Ted
3,5,"Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",18,Ted
3,5,"That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.",7,Blah-blah
3,5,Tell us what?,3,Marshall
3,5,"Lily, will you help us get the next round?",9,Ted
3,5,"Ted, what's going on?",4,Lily
3,5,"She knows about us, about how we really met.",9,Ted
3,5,"Yeah, I know, I just told her.",7,Lily
3,5,"No, the real story.",4,Ted
3,5,"Ted, what are you talking about?",6,Lily
3,5,"Lily, come on.",3,Ted
3,5,Come on what?,3,Lily
3,5,"Lily, come on.",3,Ted
3,5,"Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.",9,Lily
3,5,"Lily, come on.",3,Ted
3,5,I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.,14,Blah-blah
3,5,What? Ted and I never made out.,7,Lily
3,5,"Yeah, we did.",3,Ted
3,5,"I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",33,Lily
3,5,What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,13,Ted
3,5,That wasn't me.,3,Lily
3,5,"Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",8,Ted
3,5,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",12,Lily
3,5,"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin",24,Barney
3,5,It was right over there.,5,Barney
3,5,"Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",41,Barney
3,5,"I'm sorry, who are you again?",6,Marshall
3,5,"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.",14,Ted
3,5,"I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",57,Barney
3,5,"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",9,Ted
3,5,"No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",8,Barney
3,5,"So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",15,Ted
3,5,I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.,7,Marshall
3,5,"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",13,Barney

3,9,"I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.",33,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,9,Ooh. terrible.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,9,What?! I thought it would break the ice.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,How do you respond to something like that?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,9,Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,"Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,"Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?",18,<strong>Robin</strong>

3,9,"Um, it's my favorite.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,You're allergic.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,9,So we're making a pie for Bob.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,Yeah.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,She's got you making pies for this guy?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,9,Yeah.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,9,Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,Why?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,Because he's a thousand years old.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,"No, Ted! What are you doing?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,9,Right?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>

3,9,The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.,18,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,Ted...,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,It's mean.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,"Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?",31,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,"First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?",42,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,"Hey, that is...",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,"Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.",32,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,9,I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,9,"I'm sorry, what?",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,9,"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,9,"I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>

3,9,"Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,Apparently not.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,"We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,"Well, maybe we should stop pretending.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,9,Maybe we should.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,9,Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,9,"Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.",83,<strong>Marshall</strong>

3,9,Guess we're not.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,9,"You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.",55,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

3,13,"I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,13,"This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.",39,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,"No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself. (<em>clearing throat)</em> I mean...",15,<strong>Lily</strong>

3,13,"I swear to you, I did not.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,13,My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in?,31,<strong>Marshall</strong>

3,13,"Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>

3,13,Yes.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,13,She said &quot;crush&quot;? And she was talking about me?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,That last session was the least painful of all. I savored every searing blast of that laser.,17,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,13,All done.,2,<strong>Stella</strong>
3,13,The moment I'd waited ten weeks for had arrived.,9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

3,13,I have a daughter.,4,<strong>Stella</strong>
3,13,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,"Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call.",120,<strong>Stella</strong>
3,13,There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,"Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,13,I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.,30,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,You didn't actually say no.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,What do you mean?,4,<strong>Stella</strong>
3,13,"All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?",31,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,13,And... date.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,13,Huh?,1,<strong>Stella</strong>

3,13,My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.,11,<strong>Abby</strong>

3,14,"My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,I have one. It's called my marriage license.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,"Come on, let's see the list.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?",38,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,How many of these girls know they're being photographed?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.",45,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.,25,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.,25,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,12 hours to live!,4,Lily and Ted</strong>
3,14,Damn it!,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Okay, toss up. &quot;Thought I was Jorge Posada,&quot; or &quot;You have my dead wife's kidney?&quot;",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Kidney!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,Jorge Posada!,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,That's true...,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,It's &quot;Dead wife's kidney.&quot; How are we even discussing this?,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,Fake baby!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,Lost at sea!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,Fake baby!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,Lost at sea!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, &quot;Girl who thought I owned Google,&quot; up against the number seven seed, &quot;Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.&quot;",39,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,You got to go scuba instructor.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,You're kidding me!,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,She got the bends!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Yeah, she did.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Evil twin!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Barney, you're the tiebreaker.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,I'm going with Evil Twin.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,You're kidding me!,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.",29,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,Is that the blackboard from my classroom?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,Come on! Marshall?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,I'm tired and sad.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,Mosby?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.",41,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,You guys stole my blackboard!,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,No.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,What do you mean &quot;no&quot;?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.",30,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Barney, you're doing this.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!",56,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,What are you doing here?,5,<strong>Meg</strong>
3,14,"Look, Meg, we need to talk.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.",16,<strong>Meg</strong>
3,14,And I forgive you. I love you.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Oh, my God! I love you, too!",7,<strong>Meg</strong>
3,14,"No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...",22,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"So you remember who this one is, right?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.",22,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Ah, there she is.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,I'm making a scrapbook.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Anna, hi.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.",22,<strong>Anna</strong>
3,14,What Web site?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.,1,<strong>Anna</strong>
3,14,"You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.",45,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!",13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,14,"Okay, which one is this again?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,She's...,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Larney! Die!,2,<strong>Kate</strong>
3,14,Is it her?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Die!,1,<strong>Kate</strong>
3,14,Smile.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,You look good. Have you lost weight?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!",11,<strong>Holly</strong>
3,14,That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,She's gonna kill you.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,Barney.,1,<strong>Holly</strong>
3,14,Holly.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fianc√©. Mark.",10,<strong>Holly</strong>
3,14,Barney? You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?,10,<strong>Mark</strong>
3,14,So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?,18,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future.",14,<strong>Holly</strong>
3,14,"And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.",19,<strong>Mark</strong>
3,14,"Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Fourth of July? We started dating in June.,8,<strong>Mark</strong>
3,14,We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,20,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.",37,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,That's not a bad idea.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,I do not.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,I'm in.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.",35,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful.",10,<strong>Man</strong>
3,14,"I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Hey, there, how are you doing?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,19,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,"Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? <em></em> Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?,30,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.,19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,14,Are you okay?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,14,"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",128,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,What? What?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,14,So I apologized for nothing?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,14,"Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo &quot;Barney's Redemption.&quot; Could you stop giving me the finger?",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,14,"Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later.",15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,14,"Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself.",23,<strong>Woman</strong>

3,15,A new car!,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!",31,<strong>Barney</strong>

3,15,They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at war...,16,<strong>Marshall</strong>

3,15,You have anything in yours?,5,<strong>Man</strong>
3,15,Totally empty. you?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Candy bars.,2,<strong>Man</strong>

3,15,"...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>

3,15,"Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!",49,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Did you hear that?,4,<strong>Ferguson</strong>
3,15,"Yeah, sorry.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Can you believe he did that On &quot;Take-your-daughter-to-work&quot; day?,9,<strong>Ferguson</strong>
3,15,"So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called &quot;Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...&quot;",35,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like &quot;the ninja report&quot;?",15,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,15,"Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",30,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",31,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",44,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,All of what?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",69,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Is &quot;boy&quot; the right word?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"God, you're hot right now.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Here's what I would do if I were you.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>

3,15,So we good?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,We're so good.,3,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,Then why are you still in my office?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",43,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Observe.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,Arthur?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"What do you want, Marshall?",5,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,You are nailing this.,4,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"You got me hooked, reel me in.",7,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.,17,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",30,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...",36,<strong>Bilson</strong>
3,15,"You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.",9,<strong>Blauman</strong>
3,15,"Oh, snap.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,What?,1,<strong>Bilson</strong>
3,15,"You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?",38,<strong>Blauman</strong>
3,15,"Oh, my God.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,He peed on the conference table?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.",33,<strong>Blauman</strong>
3,15,Does this help?,3,<em>pouring some water in a glass</em>
3,15,"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,That's it? that's the end of the story?,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"No, no, of course not... he died.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,Chain of screaming?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",67,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,I thought it was a chain of screaming.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,I don't scream at Lily.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,So it's not a circle.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",66,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Oh, God.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Hello, Arthur.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Hello, Marshall.",2,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.",24,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Oh, yeah.",2,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,That's it.,2,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,...just throw her on the bed...,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,That's where she belongs.,4,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"No, the other part, please.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"I have the ninja report right here, but...",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"And it seemed like that was the end of it, but it wasn't, because the next night...",17,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,15,"Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",44,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Not good, not good at all.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Where are you right now?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Okay, I'll see you soon.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,I love you.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"I love you, too.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Wow, you two are already saying the &quot;l&quot; word, huh?",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,Apparently.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,You hitting that?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"It's just, this is a really good parking spot.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,Dude!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Look, just tell me what happened first.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Hey, marshall.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,How long have you been sitting there?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Yeah, I was just about to order.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,What do you want?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,A sandwich and gravy fries.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Okay, friends, what do you like?",6,<strong>Waiter</strong>
3,15,"A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,Very good.,2,<strong>Waiter</strong>
3,15,"No, I didn't want meatloaf.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"No, I don't.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,Who would I even scream at?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,29,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,No.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,Is that ice cream cone big enough?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Uh, it's delicious enough.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Okay, so... Then I say to Barney...",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.",42,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.",10,<strong>Waiter</strong>
3,15,Marshall.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,Excuse me?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Yes?,1,<strong>Waiter</strong>
3,15,This is not what I ordered.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Yes, it is.",3,<strong>Waiter</strong>
3,15,"I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so...",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!",55,<strong>Waiter</strong>
3,15,"Hey, what are you guys doing out here?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Oh sweet, can I get a toot?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Well, that's just not true.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,You can't call shotgun for eternity.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Well, that's funny, cause I did!",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,It's case by case.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,15,"Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Yell at me.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Yeah.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"This is me yelling at you, Barney.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"This is me yelling at you, Barney!",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,Your mom's a slut!,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Yes.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!",30,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,Keep going.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"No, I'm kidding... keep going.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...",96,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"...</strong> I quit, Arthur! I quit!",6,<strong>Marshall
3,15,"Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that.",9,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"No, no, no, the part where you said, &quot;I quit.&quot; Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.",32,<strong>Arthur</strong>
3,15,"Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,Dude!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,I'm sorry.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,"How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?",67,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Ted, screaming never solves anything.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,15,And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.,10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,15,"I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.",31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"No, you're not.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.",32,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,I love you.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"I love you, too.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,15,"Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet without going bust on the apartment.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,15,You sure about this?,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Ted, I don't think I can accept...",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"Marshall, don't make me scream at you.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,15,"Thanks a lot, buddy.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,15,"You guys did it in the car, didn't...",8,<strong>Ted</strong>

3,16,"Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising.",9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,16,"So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.",41,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?",29,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Totally. What's the occasion?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.,15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.,38,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"No, it wasn't like that.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Sounds to me like he gave you your first &quot;O, Canada!&quot; face.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted...,16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

3,16,"Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. So, that everything? All right. Listen, babe... It's over.",34,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.,7,<strong>Simon</strong>

3,16,"Well, the thing is... her folks just put in a pool.",11,<strong>Simon</strong>

3,16,I have no idea what you' talking about.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>

3,16,You're starting out with two big ones right there.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>

3,16,Point Robin.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Point Simon.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,Wait. Do they have a wave pool?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,No.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody.",18,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,16,"Hey, babe.",2,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Oh, my God.",3,<em>giggling</em>
3,16,"Okay, what the hell just happened?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Hey, Simon.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Wow, look at you. You got old.",7,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing.,13,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.",33,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park.",11,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it.",35,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,Um... <em>(clears his throat</em>)... okay. Go.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.,9,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"No, I didn't know...",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,Another kid just went; he died too.,7,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in,21,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding.",20,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,The Foreskins are still playing?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously.",12,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,I know. I'm sorry.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"So, Simon, how did you guys meet?",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Oh, I was in her video.",6,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,Starred in it is more like it.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.",14,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"I'm sorry. I've seen &quot;Let's Go to the Mall&quot; about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"No, I was in the other one.",7,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,There's another video?!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,No.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.",51,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,Okay.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.",34,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,It's called &quot;revertigo.&quot;,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, I don't know about &quot;revertigo.&quot;",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"You know who gets really bad revertigo? <em></em> Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,Michelle? She sounds hot.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,You don't know about Lily and Michelle?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,No. What about Lily and Michelle?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,What... <em>(stammers</em>) Do they make out?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,Better.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,Comparable.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,Comparable.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,I got a second chance.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,What happened?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,He came by my place tonight...,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Simon. What are you doing here?,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.,34,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Oh, I like where this is going.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?",24,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,The coup de grace.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,Finish him!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,I'd love to!,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh, hell, no!",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,I think you're gonna enjoy this.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,That my girl Michelle?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Bitch, you know it!",4,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,How she livin'?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,She living only way she know how to. Large!,9,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,"Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.,11,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,For reals.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,Yeah!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?",24,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,That rocked.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.",9,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Oh, uh, sure.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later.",10,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show.",18,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Right. So you can be, like &quot;Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out.&quot; And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs.",33,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"And now it's time for &quot;Puppy Corner,&quot; some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,What's revertigo?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,You do?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,Yeah. Ted.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,Me?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"'Sup, Shmosby?!",2,<strong>Punchy</strong>
3,16,You want to go?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,I'm already there!,3,<strong>Punchy</strong>
3,16,"Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, it was a real shock.",6,<strong>Punchy</strong>
3,16,"I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,Why?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,No reason.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,That's exactly what my mom would say.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, &quot;We forbid you from seeing this boy.&quot;",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,Lily!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!,18,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, like, a billion years ago.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"You've been drinking, haven't you?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,You're not going to that show tonight!,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Hey, so, today at work...",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Not now, Ted!",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,Geez.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!,15,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,"God, I just love seeing you so happy.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over.",7,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.,7,<strong>Simon</strong>
3,16,What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason?,31,</strong> <em>laughing</em>
3,16,"Well... I'm sorry, Robin.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,"I'm fine, really.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub.",6,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,16,"So, how's Columbia?",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,16,Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.,15,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,"Um, can I make an observation?",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.",22,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,Revertigo?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,16,"No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!",27,<strong>Michelle</strong>
3,16,"One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,16,All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"No, tonight.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Ooh. Really? <em></em>Oh! Oh, come here.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.",34,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",68,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,30,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Barney, do you want to come back to my place?",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Your place?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,Are you sure you want to do this?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Of course. So, should I just put it in?",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, why not?",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,This was my big artistic follow-up to&quot;Let's Go to the Mall.&quot; It kind of tanked.,15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,17,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Oh, I'm so glad.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,Is that Alan Thicke?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,Yeah.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,"Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,"Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,16,He was my sidekick. He had to be.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,16,And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (<em>Robin and Barney kiss)</em> they stopped watching.,27,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

3,17,"Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed.",29,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Check.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, &quot;who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?&quot;",35,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Best friend.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Okay. Right. So, Robin?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Yes, Barney?",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.,9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"So, tell us, what was it like?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,What?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,I... I... I'm... I'm...,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, you are.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,What are you talking about?!,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, &quot;try again.&quot; How you doing there, Robin?",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,I'm good.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",34,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Liking video games?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,I'm gonna get a drink.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,I'll come with you.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>

3,17,"God, this is awkward.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,What is?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Being around Ted.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Why?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Because of our thing.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,What thing?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,You're really gonna pretend this never happened?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,What never happened? What are you guys talking about?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Nothing.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Hello.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Hey, Marshall, I need your help.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,I know. I want to hire you.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,How much?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,A little.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,I'll take it.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.",39,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",39,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Of course. Why are you upset?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... <em></em> Stop..stop doing that. <em>(Barney throws a bowling ball at him, Marshall catches it)</em> I slept... I slept with Robin.",29,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,You slept with Robin?,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,Are you mad at me?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,I don't know.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,How's the hot dog?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Why are you doing this to me?!,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic.",23,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,Bro Code article one,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Some were unbelievably complicated.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,Bro Code article 89,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,And some were just plain disturbing.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,Bro Code article 34,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,The year was 1776. The place,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"But, bro, seriously, I called the dibs on that wench. You codpiece blocked me.",14,<strong>Benjamin</strong>
3,17,So what if I did? There's no rule against it.,10,<strong>George</strong>
3,17,"Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros.",21,<strong>Benjamin</strong>
3,17,"But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.",19,<strong>George</strong>
3,17,And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.,9,<strong>Benjamin</strong>
3,17,I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.,9,<strong>George</strong>
3,17,And I shall l include a provision that stateth &quot;No eye contact in a devil's three-way.&quot;,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Seconded.,1,<strong>Benjamin</strong>
3,17,Seconded.,1,<strong>George</strong>
3,17,"Listen, what do you want me for?",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states &quot;No s*x with your bro's ex.&quot; But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,And you would pay me for that?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"While Marshall examined the Bro Code, Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.",13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"You got it, toots.",4,<strong>Frank</strong>
3,17,Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?,10,<strong>Girl</strong>

3,17,And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.,28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.",8,<strong>Girl</strong>
3,17,"I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat would go on to do in that bathroom was so... No, you know what? I'm m getting ahead of myself. We'll get there.",32,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,How'd you know that was a goat turd?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,Talk about what?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,How does everyone know that's a goat turd?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Barney told you.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>

3,17,"Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.",34,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.",53,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,So he saved you from an avalanche?,7,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,17,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?,12,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,17,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob?,17,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,17,Da.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Article 29 &quot;A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.&quot;,19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,What?!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Hey.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Article 53,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,That feels nice.,3,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,17,Good.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,I just wish we had some wine.,7,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,17,"Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.",43,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,What if he never wants to talk to me again?,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Which brings us to April 25, 2008. My 30th birthday, or as it would come to be referred to in later years",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"Hey, where are you?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,Goat in a party hat?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party!",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,17,"Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Okay. Bye.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Whoa, you guys went all out.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Vegas.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,So there's no roof party?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!",75,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Take me home, Barney.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.",41,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,You slept with Robin.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!,9,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
3,17,When did you find out?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Hey, Robin. Come here!",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,What's up?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Oh, crap!",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Anyway, uh, I came across this.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,From my vacacation in Vermont.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,I slept with Barney!,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.",56,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Of course we can still be friends.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,So you're not mad?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,So you're not mad?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.",32,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,I'm so relieved to hear you say that.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,"Marshall, can we keep the goat?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,No.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,But she's so cute and furry and soft.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?,17,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,"Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,Marshall!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?,19,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,"Lily,come on.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,17,Hot wax?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,Stop it.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,Did he tie you to anything?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,That's enough. What's wrong with you?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,17,I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,17,Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!,31,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,You mean... what position? <em></em> Stop it! Stop it!,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Hit him!,2,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
3,17,Ted! Stop!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Hit him!,2,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
3,17,Stop!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,Hit him!,2,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
3,17,"Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face. <em>(Ted hits him where it hurts the most...)</em> Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?",55,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, &quot;don't do this&quot;?",64,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled &quot;stuff I have no use for anymore.&quot;",59,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,What does that mean?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,It means... maybe you belong in that box.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,"Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,17,"Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,17,Surprise!,1,<strong>Everyone</strong>
3,17,"Oh, right, the goat. So funny.You're going to love this. So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom and was eating one of Robin's washcloths and wait, hold on. Robin wasn't living here on my 30th birthday. When did this happen? Oh, wait, the goat was there on my 31st birthday. Sorry, I totally got that wrong.",61,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

3,18,No.,1,Ted
3,18,I miss Barney. I haven't &quot;high five&quot; with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.,24,Marshall
3,18,Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?,16,Robin
3,18,Yeah! She had just as much s*x with Barney as Barney had with her.,14,Lily
3,18,You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird.,23,Robin
3,18,I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple.,18,Ted
3,18,I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella.,16,Lily
3,18,"She was right.  Stella and I had been dating for two months. And things were going really well. (Stella, Ted and his friends are playing) She had mat my friend in past for flying colors. There was just one little problem.",41,Narrator

3,18,"I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.",16,Ted
3,18,So what you guys waiting for?,6,Lily
3,18,"I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.",27,Ted
3,18,"Wait, so you haven't had s*x since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.",23,Marshall
3,18,"Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day?",9,Lily
3,18,"Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.",9,Marshall
3,18,"Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?",36,Ted

3,18,Hello?,1,Willie
3,18,Hanging up on you once wasn't enough.,7,Barney
3,18,"So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere.",31,Stella
3,18,"Let's have s*x. Right now, I'll lock the door.",9,Ted
3,18,"Oh, there is no lock on that door.",8,Stella

3,18,"Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird between me and the door tomorrow.",14,Stella
3,18,I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.,6,Ted
3,18,You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make.,18,Stella
3,18,I was afraid of this. You're 14.,7,Ted
3,18,"No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone.",17,Stella
3,18,Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.,9,Ted
3,18,Really? How long it's been for you?,7,Stella
3,18,It's been a while.,4,Ted
3,18,Tell me.,2,Stella
3,18,Me too!,2,Stella
3,18,It's been five months for you too?,7,Ted
3,18,Five years!!??,2,All (except Ted)
3,18,"Wow. Stella hasn't had s*x since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had s*x, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.",31,Marshall
3,18,"Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.",21,Lily
3,18,"The last time Stella had s*x, the world was just learning about SARS.",13,Marshall
3,18,"Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?",15,Robin
3,18,"Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.",34,Stella
3,18,But nobody in five years?,5,Ted
3,18,"Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.",34,Stella
3,18,"In my defense, they were staring at me.",8,Ted
3,18,So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?,15,Lily
3,18,Actually...,1,Ted
3,18,"But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.",21,Stella
3,18,Your pillow talk's a little rusty.,6,Ted
3,18,"You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.",8,Stella
3,18,That's great. Like &quot;right now&quot; ready?,6,Ted
3,18,"So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.",19,Ted
3,18,"The last time Stella had s*x, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.",14,Marshall
3,18,Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.,8,Robin
3,18,"Not the movie, the book.",5,Marshall
3,18,Wow.,1,Robin
3,18,"It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",7,Ted
3,18,You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...,23,Lily
3,18,(V.O.) It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. (There is a shock. And Lily likes the sensation which that gets her.),35,Lily
3,18,"Oh, San Francisco!",3,Lily
3,18,"I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.",14,Ted
3,18,Notable deaths in 2003... Oh my God... Nell Carter. Did you guys know that Nell Carter had died?,18,Marshall (watching on Internet)
3,18,I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.,12,Ted
3,18,"Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.",9,Robin
3,18,Not Nell Carter... Stella.,4,Ted
3,18,"Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",17,Marshall
3,18,Because you're dead inside?,4,Ted
3,18,"No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite",22,Marshall
3,18,"Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",11,Ted
3,18,"Hey, buddy. I'm married, Barney, I cannot be your new wingman. (Marshall hangs up, then Robin's phone rings, she picks up the phone and say directly...)",26,Marshall (in the phone)
3,18,No.,1,Robin
3,18,"Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?",41,Barney
3,18,"Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back. (Then he goes in the lane, and dances. He comes back.) Tomorrow works.",23,Randy
3,18,I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.,13,Ted
3,18,Fancy?,1,Stella
3,18,"Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever.  Huh. That's surprising.",26,Ted
3,18,What?,1,Stella
3,18,"This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",42,Ted
3,18,"Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?",20,Stella
3,18,No.,1,Ted
3,18,Quick on the draw?,4,Stella
3,18,No.,1,Ted
3,18,Unexpected number of testicules?,4,Stella
3,18,"No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity",17,Ted
3,18,Virginity 2,2,Stella
3,18,"Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.",20,Ted
3,18,"Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs.",21,Stella
3,18,&quot;Unexpected number of testicules?&quot;,4,Ted
3,18,It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked.,22,Stella
3,18,Hey.,1,Barney
3,18,What up bro-seph Lieberman?,4,Randy
3,18,"No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word &quot;bro&quot; in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.",19,Barney
3,18,Goodbye &quot;Geraldine Ferrar-bro&quot;.,3,Randy
3,18,"You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.",31,Barney
3,18,What a loser.,3,Randy
3,18,"But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.",15,Barney
3,18,"Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.",36,Randy
3,18,"Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this.",6,Barney
3,18,Ok.,1,Randy
3,18,You ready?,2,Barney
3,18,"Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no!",7,Randy
3,18,What? What's the matter?,4,Barney
3,18,"Nothing, let's do this.  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!",20,Randy
3,18,Randy what are you doing?,5,Barney
3,18,"Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me",17,Randy
3,18,"(Finally Randy is ready, so Barney goes talking to the girls) Hey, laddies. Have you met... (He points the finger towards Randy and turns around. But Randy hid under a table.)",31,Barney
3,18,Hey.,1,Ted
3,18,Hey.,1,Stella
3,18,"So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...",22,Ted
3,18,Ted. Five years.,3,Stella
3,18,Straight to the hotel?,4,Ted
3,18,Straight to the hotel.,4,Stella
3,18,I'll get my bag.,4,Ted
3,18,"Hey, guys.",2,Stella
3,18,Hey.,1,Lily
3,18,"Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?",7,Marshall
3,18,Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.,14,Stella
3,18,Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a &quot;night out&quot;.,18,Lily

3,18,Hey guys.,2,Ted

3,18,You haven't had s*x in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!,19,Marshall
3,18,"Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.",23,Ted
3,18,"Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.",13,Stella
3,18,"No, they don't.",3,Ted
3,18,"Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x.",15,Stella
3,18,13 years??!!,2,Barney
3,18,I peaked really young.,4,Randy
3,18,That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.,23,Stella
3,18,You can trust me.,4,Ted
3,18,"Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours.",21,Stella
3,18,"Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?",13,Ted
3,18,Why would be looking for one?,6,Stella

3,19,Fine.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Fine.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,Pulling... Them... Off.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute...,34,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,19,I love it.,3,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,19,You do?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?",9,<strong>Woman</strong>
3,19,It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,19,We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.,20,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?,21,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,"Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors &quot;neat&quot; or are they more &quot;neato burrito?&quot;,19,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,I pull these off! (<em>Everyone is laughing at him)</em> I pull these off!,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,You know what I hate most about Ted?,8,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,What?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.",13,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,You know what I hate most about Ted?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,What?,1,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"How he's always like, &quot;Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with.&quot; He's so lame.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,He's so lame and awesome.,5,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",17,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,I think so.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,You're thinking of having s*x with Ted?,7,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate.",12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,19,Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.,17,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?",11,<strong>Man</strong>
3,19,"Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Heroin.,1,<strong>Man</strong>
3,19,Do you like heroin?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.",20,<strong>Man</strong>
3,19,"Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,It's not very good.,4,<strong>Man</strong>

3,19,"2</strong> Oh, my God!",4,<strong>Man
3,19,"500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,"Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... &quot;Suck It!&quot;",37,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,"Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,You bagged a G-CWOK?!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.,30,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.",40,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Uh, yeah.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Hi, Abby.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?",29,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.",13,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.",46,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,We're showing Ted how lame he is.,7,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"You don't have to say it, though.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.",9,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Wait, really?",2,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,I would never joke about true love.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Yes, I'll marry you.",4,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,Okay.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.",10,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,That's you.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Uh, yes, she does.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.",16,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,Totally committed to the bit.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Oh, honey, hello.",3,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,You sound happy.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.,9,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,"Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame.",19,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century.",16,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,So... y-you didn't like my painting?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you.",14,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,"Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.",7,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world.",11,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,"This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Really?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Da-amn.,1,<strong>Man</strong>
3,19,I got a two-syllable &quot;damn&quot; in this dress.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,A two-syllable &quot;damn.&quot; That's the dream.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirlMetroNewsOne.com.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,It's still in the family.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,"Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,Really? Why?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.,31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,It's still in the family.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
3,19,"And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,"Well, what happened?",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Well, hello.",2,<strong>Man 2</strong>
3,19,"Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,"Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out.",33,<strong>Lawrence</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,Here's the important part.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,"Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,Walter. Boots.,2,<strong>Lawrence</strong>
3,19,Pulling... Them.... Off.,3,<strong>Walter</strong>
3,19,I'll be in the cab.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,G-CWOK-approved.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
3,19,The painting!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,"It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,You're about to find out.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,I had to make a trash run. Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.,14,<strong>Dr Greer</strong>
3,19,"Ooh, we don't need the details.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think. Oh, thank God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles.",17,<strong>Dr Greer</strong>
3,19,"Anyway... I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, &quot;Hey,free painting,&quot; so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets.",93,<strong>Dr Greer</strong>
3,19,Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.,14,<strong>Dr Greer</strong>
3,19,Really? Dogs like my paintings?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan.",32,<strong>Dr Greer</strong>
3,19,"Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,Really?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,In what?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,In you.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.,18,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
3,19,"Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
3,19,"Man, birds do not get you.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
3,19,"Hi, sweetie.",2,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population",7,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.",24,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,What?,1,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,Really?,1,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
3,19,"Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.",12,<strong>Abby</strong>
3,19,"Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>

4,1,Really?,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?,36,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

4,1,Just ask her out.,4,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,"Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face.

4,1,You've got to calm down.,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,"I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?",21,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,"Dude, it's just a movie.",5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,"Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.",28,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>

4,1,"If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her.",10,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

4,1,You want to watch it again?,6,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,I do.,2,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.,11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.,10,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,Why?,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.",35,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,"Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.",17,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.,16,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,"You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?",12,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,Ted hit that for over a year.,7,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,Wish me luck.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.",28,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

4,1,"I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.",10,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,Why are you acting like this?,6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,Like what?,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.",14,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,"I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.",16,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.,22,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.",28,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,Your teeth look fantastic.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,Who are you?,3,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,What?,1,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,Nothing.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,You were staring at me.,5,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,You look really beautiful tonight.,5,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,"You don't look so bad yourself, mister. <em>She kisses him on the neck</em>",13,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,"Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.",33,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,"Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?",10,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,Nothing.,1,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,"Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.",40,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,"Should I leave, too?",4,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,"What part, what part?",4,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,Thanks.,1,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?,24,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,"I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.",33,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.",32,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,Why not?,2,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.,16,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.,11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,It's not as easy...,4,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,Promise me you'll apply.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,I promise.,2,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,"She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor.",18,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,Great scene.,2,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,"Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.",14,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.,11,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,I'll tell her you still want to be friends.,9,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,"I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...<em></em> &quot;Stop watching me, jackasses.&quot;",19,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>

4,1,Last call.,2,<strong><em>Barman</em></strong>
4,1,Of course it is. One more for the road?,9,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?",6,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,I loved it.,3,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.,18,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,What was that?,3,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,"I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you m*st*rb*t*ng little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. <em>Ted leaves the room.</em>",26,<strong><em>Ted</em></strong>
4,1,It was so good.,4,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,"You hated it, didn't you?",5,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,"It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?",20,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,Wookiee.,1,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,"He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, &quot;That's a good point, Bear, &quot;let's try that.&quot;",16,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,"He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?",84,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,I do.,2,<strong><em>Stella</em></strong>
4,1,"Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.",6,<strong><em>Marshall</em></strong>
4,1,"So, here's the deal.",4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.",17,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?,11,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.",54,<strong><em>Robin</em></strong>
4,1,So are you... nervous about the game?,7,<strong><em>April</em></strong>
4,1,"Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.",66,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,And that was it.,4,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...",22,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,"When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?",15,<strong><em>April</em></strong>
4,1,"My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true.",26,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.",34,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,I choose bimbos.,3,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,What?,1,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,"Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.",41,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>
4,1,"This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.",15,<strong><em>Lily</em></strong>
4,1,"Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?",66,<strong><em>Barney</em></strong>

4,2,I don't know<em>. (Looking to his watch.)</em> Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9,16,Marshall

4,2,Damn it! Where is this place?,6,Marshall <em>(Raising hands in the sky.)</em>
4,2,You couldn't find it?,4,Robin
4,2,We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.,22,Ted
4,2,"Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?",7,Marshall
4,2,Where do you think it was?,6,Robin
4,2,Probably tucked between her legs.,5,Lily
4,2,You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.,18,Barney

4,2,"Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee",53,Marshall
4,2,So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.,9,Robin

4,2,The autographed picture.,3,Marshall <em>(Watching Ted)</em>

4,2,"That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?",11,Marshall
4,2,No! I never wrote it down. But not a day goes by that I don't regret it. <em></em> Why? Why? Do you know where it is?,26,Regis Philbin<em>(He knocks in a bag of boxing.)</em>

4,2,What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!,11,Regis Philbin
4,2,All right.,2,Barney
4,2,"Let's go, all of you!",5,Regis Philbin
4,2,That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says &quot;Burger.&quot;,26,Marshall
4,2,"Green door, red neon sign that says &quot;Burger?&quot;",8,Robin
4,2,Yeah.,1,Marshall
4,2,"I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.",19,Robin
4,2,I knew it was on a numbered street!,8,Marshall
4,2,Finally.,1,Robin
4,2,"No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! <em>He throws away the burger.</em>",29,Marshall <em>(taking Robin's burger in his hands)</em>
4,2,No...,1,Robin
4,2,I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger,9,Marshall
4,2,"Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.",22,Lily
4,2,"You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.",23,Barney
4,2,"Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.",16,Lily
4,2,"How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. <em>He laughs.</em>",36,Barney
4,2,We should probably call Regis.,5,Ted

4,2,"Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.",17,Marshall

4,2,Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.,18,Ted
4,2,I think I just had my first burg-asm.,8,Lily
4,2,"I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?",45,Barney
4,2,This isn't it.,3,Marshall <em>(putting his burger in his plate)</em>
4,2,What?,1,Everybody
4,2,It's not it.,3,Marshall
4,2,"Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same",18,Ted
4,2,"I mean, it is just a burger.",7,Robin
4,2,"Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive &quot;pas de deux&quot;. And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.",112,Marshall
4,2,And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.,9,Lily
4,2,"Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says &quot;Burger&quot;. I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.",53,Marshall
4,2,I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.,17,Robin

4,2,Did you put on pants today?,6,Lily
4,2,Nope. <em>They laugh.</em>,3,Marshall
4,2,"It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, &quot;Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that.&quot; Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.",45,Lily
4,2,"Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.",29,Ted

4,2,We're going.,2,Marshall
4,2,"Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.",8,Ted
4,2,"You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. <em>He starts singing.</em> &quot;<em>We'll be on your side when you need a friend.

4,4,"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.",14,Marshall
4,4,I meet this challenge.,4,Barney
4,4,What challenge?,2,Marshall
4,4,Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.,24,Barney
4,4,"I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged.",14,Marshall
4,4,I want to hear the other letters.,7,Ted
4,4,This is ridiculous. It changed his mind.,7,Lily

4,4,&quot;The capabilities of Gilbert reading have improved considerably... &quot;This is a letter I had to give one of my students.,20,Lily
4,4,Things go too fast between you and a girl named Stella?,11,Woman
4,4,I'd like.,2,Boy
4,4,I can hear yours?,4,Ted
4,4,"&quot;Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin. &quot;",25,Robin
4,4,You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?,14,Ted
4,4,"I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?",26,Robin
4,4,Water has flowed under the bridge...,6,Marshall
4,4,Come on.,2,Ted
4,4,"&quot;Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer. &quot; It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement.",86,Marshall
4,4,Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.,10,Ted
4,4,And we're here.,3,Marshall
4,4,And we hope you're not sorry.,6,Robin
4,4,Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.,14,Ted
4,4,But concerns that a completely expelled.,6,Lily
4,4,But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.,10,Ted
4,4,"You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know.",12,Marshall
4,4,"I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?",41,Ted
4,4,Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low.,14,Marshall
4,4,"My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?",25,Ted
4,4,It was sophisticated.,3,Lily
4,4,My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!,14,Ted
4,4,What are you doing?,4,Robin
4,4,I unpack. I never leave this apartment.,7,Ted
4,4,"Ted, stop unpacking. You're in the process of pinball.",9,Lily
4,4,"I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!",33,Ted

4,4,Hey.,1,Ted
4,4,Come here a minute.,4,Marshall
4,4,What?,1,Ted
4,4,"Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the knife? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!",90,Marshall
4,4,"Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. &quot;Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler. &quot;",25,Robin
4,4,I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.,13,Marshall
4,4,"You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily.",35,Robin
4,4,"This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either.",14,Lily
4,4,Come on.,2,Robin
4,4,"Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump.",10,Lily
4,4,"My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you.",50,Robin
4,4,"Oh, honey.",2,Lily
4,4,"Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good?",11,Marshall
4,4,"Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!",24,Ted
4,4,"Oh, my God!",3,Ted
4,4,I think someone owes me $ 200.,7,Barney
4,4,"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...",7,Marshall
4,4,This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis.,18,Barney (old)
4,4,I am moving to New Jersey.,6,Ted
4,4,What?,1,Lily
4,4,"And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan.",14,Ted
4,4,Why?,1,Robin
4,4,"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is",13,Ted
4,4,"You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years.",17,Barney (old)

4,4,"And a year later, that's exactly what we did.",9,Ted (2030)
4,4,"So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell.",16,Ted
4,4,Amazing.,1,Robin
4,4,It's amazing.,2,Barney
4,4,"It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?",19,Ted

4,5,There's no meat.,3,Marshall
4,5,There's no alcohol.,3,Lily
4,5,"Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors.",19,Marshall

4,5,"Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.",17,Ted
4,5,Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?,9,Stella
4,5,She already has his ticket.,5,Ted
4,5,It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.,13,Stella
4,5,It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.,11,Ted

4,5,"OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.",22,Ted
4,5,You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.,9,Lily
4,5,What do you mean by &quot;delicate&quot;?,6,Ted
4,5,"The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.",15,Lily
4,5,Do not you remember?,4,Marshall
4,5,The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?,42,Lily
4,5,"After a while, is that the waffle.",7,Marshall
4,5,Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.,11,Lily

4,5,You are Barney?,3,Nora

4,5,"Look, here's the thing...",4,Ted
4,5,You can not take it.,5,Tony
4,5,"Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.",44,Ted
4,5,"You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had.",20,Tony
4,5,Let's cuddle.,2,Ted

4,5,Let me talk to Stella first.,6,Ted
4,5,Mom! Ted invited Dad!,4,Lucy

4,5,What did Ted this time?,5,Robin
4,5,What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.,14,Stella
4,5,To be fair... your ex is here.,7,Ted
4,5,You've invited!,2,Stella
4,5,"Come on, it's not weird.",5,Ted
4,5,"It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.",41,Stella

4,5,Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream?,10,Stella
4,5,But I have not done.,5,Ted (2030)
4,5,You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.,16,Ted
4,5,Of course.,2,Stella
4,5,Sorry to have run away like that.,7,Ted
4,5,"It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...",32,Robin
4,5,You can not come to the wedding.,7,Ted
4,5,thank you God!,3,Robin
4,5,What?,1,Ted
4,5,It's weird.,2,Robin
4,5,It's not weird.,3,Ted
4,5,It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?,14,Robin
4,5,"Take that, bitch! I won!",5,Stella
4,5,"It was broken, there is more than a year.",9,Ted
4,5,"Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.",39,Robin
4,5,"So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.",8,Ted
4,5,That's not it. It's just...,5,Robin
4,5,Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.,10,Ted
4,5,"Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.",23,Robin
4,5,"It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...",31,Ted
4,5,I quit my job.,4,Robin
4,5,You what?,2,Ted
4,5,"I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.",24,Robin
4,5,What does that mean?,4,Ted
4,5,"You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.",33,Robin
4,5,I did the rain.,4,Ted
4,5,"It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.",45,Robin
4,5,I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.,22,Ted
4,5,Big fight?,2,Bartender
4,5,Yes.,1,Robin
4,5,There you go. It is for me.,7,Barman
4,5,"You stop it.  My God, so, stop.",7,Robin

4,6,The blue line?,3,Barney
4,6,"You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that &quot;crease&quot; speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.",60,Robin
4,6,You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,12,Lily
4,6,"That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done.

Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late.

4,11,This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?,13,Robin

4,11,What? Why do this?,4,Ted
4,11,Because you deserve it.,4,Heather
4,11,"Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe.",53,Barney
4,11,"You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas.",30,Heather

In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut.

4,15,Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?,6,Barney
4,15,Yes?,1,Grant
4,15,"You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s.",17,Barney
4,15,It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.,13,Lily
4,15,It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.,9,Marshall
4,15,"Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat.",43,Barney
4,15,"Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?",12,Lily
4,15,"No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid",23,Barney
4,15,"I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&amp;ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!",30,Ted
4,15,Really?,1,Betty
4,15,Yes.,1,Ted
4,15,"Thank you. I know not, finally, the purpose of Brecht's work is of course...",14,Betty
4,15,... to confuse people.,4,Ted and Betty
4,15,Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee!,8,Ted
4,15,You know it really theater.,5,Betty
4,15,"Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids.",26,Ted
4,15,"Hey, Santa, do you think we can take off with this weather?",12,Boy
4,15,"Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.",37,Ted
4,15,I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.,18,Ted
4,15,"Look, if you want, I can give you advice as an actor.",12,Betty
4,15,Really?,1,Ted
4,15,I would love. Rule number one player...,7,Betty
4,15,At least one person who still loves to play. I miss that.,12,Grant
4,15,You do not like playing the son of Barney?,9,Robin
4,15,I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call.,12,Grant
4,15,I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4,24,Robin
4,15,"Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose.",10,Grant
4,15,I have not had surgery.,5,Robin
4,15,That's it. Neither do I.,5,Grant
4,15,I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?,18,Lily
4,15,"Thank you, darling. Actually, I was not so perfect a mother when I was younger.",15,Loretta
4,15,Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.,9,Marshall
4,15,"Yeah, I was rather a drag.",6,Loretta
4,15,I'm sorry?,2,Lily
4,15,"A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, &quot;I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet. &quot; Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive.",63,Loretta
4,15,Barney Mom? Loretta.,3,Marshall
4,15,"Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect.",24,Loretta
4,15,"You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.",23,Marshall
4,15,"No, no question. The truth would kill her.",8,Barney
4,15,"I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?",23,Marshall
4,15,"Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, &quot;Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. &quot;",32,Lily
4,15,She was joking.,3,Marshall
4,15,"She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.",8,Lily
4,15,You're going to say what?,5,Marshall
4,15,Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?,13,Lily
4,15,On the bed &quot;race car&quot;?,5,Barney
4,15,"The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it.",37,Marshall
4,15,Really? I hate your mother.,5,Lily
4,15,You know what? I hate you!,6,Marshall
4,15,"In two minutes, meat loaf!",5,Loretta
4,15,Meatloaf? Tyler to love!,4,Tyler
4,15,We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!,11,Barney
4,15,But it's funny.,3,Grant
4,15,I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.,14,Barney
4,15,Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?,8,Robin
4,15,Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.,13,Barney
4,15,What kind?,2,Robin
4,15,"And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.",22,Betty
4,15,The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!,17,Barney
4,15,You better stop!,3,Betty
4,15,"Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.",12,Barney
4,15,"So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe?",19,Betty
4,15,"No, not at all.",4,Lily
4,15,And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?,6,Loretta
4,15,"Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?",24,Barney
4,15,Well...,1,Tyler
4,15,Page 4...,2,Barney
4,15,The dinosaur bones at the museum have come back to life and chasing me?,14,Tyler
4,15,"Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.",10,Marshall
4,15,Tyler said,2,Barney
4,15,It was cute.,3,Loretta
4,15,We're a happy family.,4,Barney
4,15,I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.,18,Loretta
4,15,No weak link in this scene. Bravo!,7,Barney
4,15,"Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.",26,Robin
4,15,You can stop with that?,5,Marshall
4,15,Go and eat your ice.,5,Barney
4,15,I can not. I'm lactose intolerant.,6,Grant
4,15,Guess who is not lactose intolerant,6,Barney
4,15,It's time for ice!,4,Loretta
4,15,Yum!,1,Barney
4,15,My God!,2,Loretta

4,15,You're not gonna get us out a slogan.,8,Barney
4,15,I do not understand.,4,Loretta
4,15,"I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep!",35,Barney
4,15,I do not want my mom and dad divorced!,9,Tyler
4,15,What can you have to say for yourself?,8,Barney
4,15,Rule number one player,4,Betty
4,15,"Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?",11,Ted
4,15,Sorry. What?,2,Barney
4,15,Rule number 5 player,4,Betty
4,15,"November 14, 1998. The night train to Monte Carlo. I was in the car pool arnaquant Algerians few thousand dinars, while thou s√©duisais my bride! Who is blind and took you for me.",33,Ted
4,15,"For God's sake, what are you talking?",7,Barney
4,15,Rule number 8 player,4,Betty
4,15,You know not well what I mean?,7,Ted
4,15,"No, not at all.",4,Barney
4,15,"Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!",13,Ted
4,15,"Mom, you leave us a moment?",6,Barney
4,15,There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows.,14,Loretta
4,15,You've lost your mind?,4,Barney
4,15,You were amazing! You really become that character.,8,Betty
4,15,"Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.",12,Ted
4,15,What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?,12,Barney
4,15,It may be time to tell him the truth.,9,Lily
4,15,"I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m!",35,Marshall
4,15,How were my tears?,4,Grant
4,15,"Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do.",17,Robin
4,15,It may be like that in your new job.,9,Grant
4,15,You think so?,3,Robin
4,15,I know.,2,Grant
4,15,"Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that?",9,Robin
4,15,We are sorry! I thought something was happening.,8,Grant
4,15,"Honey, you okay?",3,Loretta
4,15,"Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over.",36,Barney
4,15,My God!,2,Loretta
4,15,None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.,22,Barney
4,15,What?,1,Loretta
4,15,"I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom.",29,Barney

4,15,"I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me?",12,Barney
4,15,"I'm confused. I do not know why you thought having to do that. I love you, perfect family or not. I love you, no matter what.",26,Loretta
4,15,Really?,1,Barney
4,15,Really.,1,Loretta
4,15,"I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you.",27,Barney
4,15,Whatever. I love you always.,5,Loretta
4,15,"Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do.",9,Barney

4,16,That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.,10,Ted
4,16,Why do you say &quot;the restaurant&quot;? You've embraced elsewhere?,9,Lily
4,16,"As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?",16,Ted
4,16,You did what?,3,Marshall

4,16,"Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table.",14,Lily

Ohio, Karen, in college... it was A.S. &quot;Before Stinson.&quot; Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your skills are almost nonexistent.

4,16,What is the result with the bimbo?,7,Robin

4,16,"Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.",9,Lily

4,16,Awesome. Thank you.,3,Lily
4,16,And you did not give him.,6,Ted

4,16,Not this time.,3,Ted
4,16,You have a boyfriend?,4,Ted
4,16,It's a moment you move away. I intended to break.,10,Karen
4,16,"You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all.",21,Ted
4,16,"OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel.",37,Karen
4,16,We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.,23,Ted
4,16,"Ted, wait. In fact, &quot;good bye&quot; means &quot;until we see each other again.&quot; So I guess you mean that in fact, we'll meet again?",24,Karen

4,16,The pants. Still tells.,4,Barney
4,16,"You know, this is perhaps good that you called Karen.",10,Lily
4,16,"Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me.",22,Ted
4,16,"You see, children, sometimes when you have to have a difficult discussion, the better to do...",16,Ted (2030)
4,16,Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?,19,Lily

4,17,Do not say that.,4,Robin
4,17,Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18.

4,17,The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.,12,Marshall
4,17,"I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?",24,Barney
4,17,It says you're great and everything will be fine.,9,Marshall
4,17,It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?,13,Barney

4,17,"The next night, I always wanted your aunt Lily.Until...",9,Ted (2030)
4,17,What are you doing...  Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you.,18,Karen

4,19,My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?,11,Marshall

4,19,"The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?",11,Marshall
4,19,Yeah!,1,All
4,19,"Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little sh1ts, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! Suicide, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.",44,Marshall
4,19,"There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.",27,Barney
4,19,"Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.",20,Ted
4,19,"Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.",25,Barney
4,19,And if you fail?,4,Ted

4,19,Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.,13,Robin
4,19,"There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?",19,Ted
4,19,"&quot;To pierce the ear. &quot;Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon?",29,Barney

4,19,"Put it there, guys.",4,Barney
4,19,What's the matter?,3,Robin

4,19,I'm too old for this stuff.,6,Robin
4,19,You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.,16,Ted
4,19,"What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, &quot;pushing a medical&quot; on the list.  Hold on. Bar here...",27,Barney

4,19,"OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.",9,Ted
4,19,"No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth!  You should have a straw?",23,Barney
4,19,There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?,14,Robin
4,19,"This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.",52,Ted
4,19,"It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.",17,Robin
4,19,"I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.",10,Ted
4,19,"Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?",7,Lily
4,19,"I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.",25,Marshall
4,19,Winning? There are no points.,5,Lily
4,19,What?,1,Marshall
4,19,There are no points.,4,Lily

4,19,"I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.",18,Ted
4,19,Okay. It's good. You have your own list.,8,Robin

4,19,"New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.",31,Barney
4,19,"Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.",35,Ted
4,19,Bet held.,2,Barney
4,19,An agreement of honor!,4,Robin
4,19,"Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.",11,Lily

4,19,"Come on, Dad. I'm tired.",5,Marshall
4,19,Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled.,13,Father
4,19,I'm trying.,2,Marshall
4,19,I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.,18,Father

4,19,"Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.",22,Lily
4,19,"Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.",32,Marshall
4,19,"OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?",58,Lily

4,19,"Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that.",36,Ted (2030)
4,19,"Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not shoot! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?",31,Marshall
4,19,"I'm no referee, but Kenny. And watch your tone.",9,Referee
4,19,"No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.",11,Marshall

4,19,"Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.",12,Ted
4,19,"No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is killing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.",83,Barney
4,19,"You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon.",29,Ted
4,19,"I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized...",24,Ted
4,19,... that Murtaugh kept repeating,5,Ted
4,19,And then the hospital.,4,Barney
4,19,"Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.",25,Marshall
4,19,"What are we doing wrong, coach?",6,Boy
4,19,"You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.",46,Marshall
4,19,"Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation.",22,Ted (2030)

4,19,"OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.",11,Lily
4,19,"Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf.",55,Ted (2030)
4,19,There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.,12,Marshall
4,19,"They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.",11,Lily

4,19,"Attention, coach, or I put a technical foul.",8,Kenny
4,19,I beg you to put me in one.,8,Marshall
4,19,"When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation.",34,Ted (2030)

4,20,"I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.",40,Marshall
4,20,"It's funny anyway, right?",4,Barney
4,20,It's very funny.,3,Marshall
4,20,"Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.",24,Ted
4,20,You know what? I had to send the wrong photo.,10,PJ
4,20,"You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a shooting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.",38,Ted
4,20,You can not fire me...,5,PJ
4,20,You're fired.,2,Ted
4,20,"Well!  Hi, baby, I've just been fired.Yes, I'll wait with you.  The Wheel of Fortune.",15,PJ
4,20,I like having all this time to spend with you book. I'll kiss you there... And there... And here and there. And...,22,PJ
4,20,One more.,2,Robin
4,20,Stop.,1,Ted
4,20,I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you.,8,PJ
4,20,I'll miss you too.,4,Robin
4,20,You've already tired of him.,5,Ted
4,20,"It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream.",35,Robin
4,20,&quot;It's the dream&quot;? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?,11,Ted
4,20,"I have to stop, right? I know not break.",9,Robin
4,20,"I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you.",14,PJ
4,20,"Listen... Dude, I know.",4,Robin
4,20,What?,1,PJ
4,20,"Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?",9,Robin
4,20,It's on what?,3,PJ
4,20,I feel it.,3,Robin
4,20,Do you not feel anything?,5,PJ
4,20,But friends and others.,4,Robin
4,20,"My God, this is the worst break.",7,Ted
4,20,You're breaking up with me?,5,PJ
4,20,"If this is what you want, I totally understand.",9,Robin
4,20,You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.,14,Toy-man
4,20,"You see, Sports-man. People adore you.",6,Barney
4,20,"I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow.",29,Marshall
4,20,"Hi, dude. We need you to do this exchange, I can prepare my team. You are really tight, is it not?",21,Douglas
4,20,"Seriously, it's over.",3,Marshall
4,20,I stop?,2,Douglas
4,20,No.,1,Marshall
4,20,"With the breakdown of Robin and PJ, I was free to change the personnel office.",15,Ted (2030)
4,20,Welcome Mosbius Designs.,3,PJ
4,20,Are you kidding?,3,Robin
4,20,Now that PJ came back to work...,7,Ted (2030)
4,20,Are you kidding?,3,Ted
4,20,"Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.",7,Marshall
4,20,You're kidding!,2,Barney
4,20,How are you?,3,Marshall
4,20,"As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...",28,Barney
4,20,I know you're in love with Robin.,7,Marshall
4,20,What?,1,Barney
4,20,Lily told me.,3,Marshall
4,20,She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.,13,Barney
4,20,"Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.",10,Marshall
4,20,Really?,1,Barney
4,20,It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.,16,Marshall
4,20,"Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.",51,Barney
4,20,Tell her how you feel?,5,Marshall
4,20,"No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.",30,Barney
4,20,I can perhaps help you.,5,Marshall
4,20,"You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.",27,Barney
4,20,"Meanwhile, I thank you without fight against Robin and PJ continued.",11,Ted (2030)
4,20,I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?,12,Ted
4,20,I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?,13,Robin
4,20,"Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss.",25,PJ
4,20,Manny Ramirez is not exchange against two replacements!,8,Chow-Man
4,20,"If you put your veto, I am going!",8,Toy-man
4,20,I'll find something.,3,PJ
4,20,"Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.",20,Barney
4,20,Are you okay?,3,Robin
4,20,And if I did not think the books?,8,Ted
4,20,Sorry?,1,Robin
4,20,"There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?",54,Ted
4,20,"No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.",24,Robin
4,20,"The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.",31,Ted
4,20,"You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy &quot;funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious.&quot; And apparently, I just... &quot;In my apartment.&quot; You thought that you would have understood, now?",29,Robin
4,20,"Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.",44,Ted
4,20,You can do it.,4,Robin
4,20,"Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.",14,Ted
4,20,It looks good.,3,Robin
4,20,I looked confident?,3,Ted
4,20,Now known as a real customer.,6,Robin
4,20,Great.,1,Ted
4,20,"Hey, Chow-man!",2,Marshall
4,20,"Hey, Toy-man!",2,Barney
4,20,Who's this guy?,3,Marshall
4,20,He is not here. I think we should leave.,9,Barney

4,21,Super. So I'll call you.,5,Ted
4,21,I hope so.,3,Woman
4,21,Look at this.,3,Marshall
4,21,I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.,9,Ted
4,21,"Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.",14,Barney
4,21,"Yeah, it's true.",3,Marshall
4,21,"And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.",37,Barney
4,21,You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do &quot;you remember me? It's been a &quot;. It's funny because I just saw.,26,Ted
4,21,You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.,13,Barney
4,21,"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, &quot;you like him, you call him.&quot;",29,Ted
4,21,Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.,11,Barney
4,21,"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?",11,Ted
4,21,Jesus.,1,Barney
4,21,"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.",8,Marshall
4,21,Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said,37,Barney
4,21,The dialogues seem pompous old now.,6,Robin
4,21,"And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.",28,Barney
4,21,"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.",8,Ted
4,21,"And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, &quot;No, Jesus died.&quot; Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the &quot;tope there! &quot;3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.",62,Barney
4,21,Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.,10,Ted
4,21,"But I said nothing about texting. I started with something pretty and charming. &quot;I thought about you, then, I thought you send a text message piti.&quot; By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then...(23 minutes later...) you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message...  &quot;I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath.&quot;",98,Ted (2030)
4,21,What was that?,3,Robin
4,21,What?,1,Ted
4,21,You made a noise.,4,Robin
4,21,"This is my laptop, a text message.",7,Ted
4,21,Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.,10,Robin
4,21,What?,1,Ted
4,21,"When you see a naked girl, you make noise.",9,Robin
4,21,That's not true.,3,Ted
4,21,Really?,1,Robin
4,21,"Sorry, Lily.",2,Ted
4,21,"While the men hunt, women of the Korowai tribe native wash their clothes in the river.",16,Voice
4,21,It's a breast.,3,Ted
4,21,This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?,14,Robin
4,21,"To call. Texting, it's different.",5,Ted
4,21,"Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.",11,Robin
4,21,I make no noise.,4,Ted
4,21,Really?,1,Robin
4,21,"Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect.",18,Ted (2030)
4,21,Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.,10,Ted
4,21,"Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.",16,Robin
4,21,How do you know?,4,Ted
4,21,"Because no woman in history has never, &quot;asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. &quot;",18,Robin
4,21,"Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.",11,Ted
4,21,What?,1,Robin
4,21,She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.,11,Ted
4,21,"&quot;Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. &quot;Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.",30,Robin
4,21,Come down.,2,Ted
4,21,&quot;And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.&quot;Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.,23,Robin
4,21,Hi guys! What is it?,5,Robin
4,21,A meal that I Generro back to Lily.,8,Marshall
4,21,Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!,17,Robin
4,21,What?,1,Barney
4,21,You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?,15,Robin
4,21,"We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.",22,Barney
4,21,"We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.",14,Marshall
4,21,&quot;Piti texting&quot;?,2,Barney
4,21,"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.",10,Marshall
4,21,Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.,12,Barney
4,21,It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.,12,Marshall
4,21,It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look &quot;cowboy&quot; sexy.,18,Barney
4,21,It's better.,2,Marshall
4,21,I wear them right now and they are very sexy.,10,Ted
4,21,He put the boots!,4,Barney
4,21,He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.,15,Marshall
4,21,Or... we remove our shirts.,5,Barney
4,21,It's better.,2,Marshall
4,21,"Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.",9,Barney
4,21,I believe that wearing anything underneath.,6,Marshall
4,21,It is hot.,3,Barney
4,21,"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!",9,Marshall
4,21,Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?,11,Barney
4,21,I think we'll... have s*x with Ted.,7,Marshall
4,21,You did this all day? This is wicked.,8,Robin
4,21,"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.",21,Marshall
4,21,"The crazy eyes, &quot;I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything.&quot;",13,Barney
4,21,The same he had with you the first time.,9,Marshall
4,21,We all know what it gave.,6,Barney
4,21,I'm in love with you.,5,Ted
4,21,What?,1,Robin
4,21,I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash,19,Robin
4,21,It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say &quot;I love you&quot; when he contacted her.,23,Marshall
4,21,And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.,9,Barney
4,21,First,1,Marshall
4,21,&quot;You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? &quot;,13,Barney
4,21,Deuzio,1,Marshall
4,21,&quot;I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. &quot;,11,Barney
4,21,Third,1,Marshall
4,21,&quot;My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. &quot;,12,Barney
4,21,And he really knows not what means MDR.,8,Robin
4,21,"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say &quot;I love you&quot; as easily as we thought.",17,Marshall
4,21,And then we met Stan.,5,Barney
4,21,Why do you so much noise?,6,Stan
4,21,"So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.",11,Marshall
4,21,"Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug.",33,Stan
4,21,Super Stan. Who is it?,5,Robin
4,21,A guard who works nights.,5,Barney
4,21,He eats here every day.,5,Marshall
4,21,And he had not finished.,5,Barney
4,21,Far from it.,3,Marshall
4,21,"I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you.",21,Stan
4,21,It's... really nice.,3,Marshall
4,21,No matter. It's OK.,4,Barney
4,21,"&quot;And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces. &quot;",13,Holly
4,21,Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now.,29,Stan
4,21,You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.,11,Marshall
4,21,"&quot;I do not ask someone to explain the night. I wait and it envelops me. And you're like bread, light and shadow. &quot;",23,Holly
4,21,This is Pablo Neruda.,4,Stan
4,21,"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.",17,Marshall
4,21,"Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you.",11,Barney
4,21,That's cool. Still nothing?,4,Stan
4,21,It is perhaps not in love with us.,8,Marshall
4,21,How is this possible? It's all there waiting!,8,Barney
4,21,I do not understand men.,5,Marshall
4,21,I go to work.,4,Stan
4,21,Do... you come back?,4,Marshall
4,21,"I'll be back when the wind, destiny and luck will take me back. That is to say tomorrow. This is the day of the cheesesteak.",25,Stan
4,21,That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?,19,Robin
4,21,All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.,14,Barney
4,21,"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens",13,Robin
4,21,Yes.  Or...,2,Barney
4,21,"Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.",14,Ted
4,21,Really? How she explained the scope of texting?,8,Robin
4,21,"Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.",17,Ted
4,21,Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.,7,Robin
4,21,"And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.",20,Ted
4,21,You cling to Barney and Marshall.,6,Robin
4,21,What?,1,Ted
4,21,"They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall.",25,Robin
4,21,"Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?",32,Ted
4,21,I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.,12,Robin
4,21,It's true.,2,Ted
4,21,"Yes, it was them.",4,Robin
4,21,Incredible!,1,Ted
4,21,I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.,11,Robin
4,21,Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.,12,Ted
4,21,I see. Why not,4,Robin
4,21,Not bad. And,3,Ted
4,21,I love this thing someone said about three months to live.,11,Robin
4,21,&quot;I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. &quot;,15,Ted
4,21,"It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live.",15,Robin
4,21,Wait. I think I have.,5,Ted
4,21,"He replied! &quot;I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. &quot;",20,Marshall
4,21,"That's it, man. This is the &quot;I love you.&quot;",9,Barney
4,21,I would like Stan to be there.,7,Marshall
4,21,Stan. What?,2,Barney
4,21,&quot;I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.&quot;,9,Marshall
4,21,&quot;I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. &quot;,10,Barney
4,21,"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?",19,Marshall
4,21,Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.,7,Barney
4,21,"Dude, I'm his best friend.",5,Marshall
4,21,"Okay, one",2,Barney
4,21,"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.",40,Marshall
4,21,I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.,21,Barney
4,21,"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he √©poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?",25,Marshall
4,21,I know. It's weird.,4,Barney
4,21,"Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.",8,Barney
4,21,"And by &quot;me&quot;, he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.",12,Marshall
4,21,"So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?",25,Robin
4,21,Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?,12,Marshall
4,21,"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.",15,Ted
4,21,You can tell us. This is a secure area.,9,Barney
4,21,Your feelings are quite natural.,5,Marshall
4,21,That's what happened.,3,Ted
4,21,"And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects.",25,Ted (2030)
4,21,"Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, &quot;Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.&quot;Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.",32,Ted
4,21,That's it?,2,Marshall
4,21,No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?,7,Barney
4,21,"OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?",16,Marshall
4,21,Of course.,2,Ted
4,21,"So, the machines... killed everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?",19,Marshall
4,21,And.. why should I &quot;make me&quot; one of you?,9,Ted
4,21,Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.,11,Barney
4,21,"It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?",50,Ted
4,21,I loved that he called me right away. It's very romantic.And I do not assoies home to read architectural magazines uniformed cheerleader. I do it naked.,26,Holly
4,21,Holly and I are going to dinner.,7,Ted
4,21,I'll meet you outside.,4,Holly
4,21,Sorry. It was just trying to help you.,8,Marshall
4,21,"And also, it was really funny.",6,Barney
4,21,"I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an &quot;I&quot;.",76,Ted
4,21,"I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date.",34,Ted (2030)
4,21,"It's funny! I also love indie music. We should get married. I laugh. Or not? I laugh again. That's it. We go to Brazil together! I saw my doctor this morning, he told me that everything was settled, so I can go. I think I love you.",47,Holly
4,21,"Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this. When I was your mother's number, I called immediately.",38,Ted (2030)
4,21,"Hi, friends.",2,Stan
4,21,You work right?,3,Barney
4,21,I took leave.,3,Stan
4,21,Great! We can have fun!,5,Marshall
4,21,I can not. I have a date. Ready?,8,Stan
4,21,Yes.,1,Robin
4,21,What...,1,Barney

4,24,"OK, I'm just asking. You really want to recover?",9,Lily
4,24,What does that mean?,4,Ted
4,24,"Architecture is killing you and it kills us to see her kill you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want?",49,Lily
4,24,Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.,12,Ted
4,24,"In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter.",24,Lily
4,24,I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am.,12,Robin
4,24,It continues? Bravo.,3,Lily
4,24,"What someone looks, please.",4,Robin
4,24,Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself.,34,Lily
4,24,"So what, I should do anything?",6,Ted
4,24,Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap.,12,Lily
4,24,"You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily.",9,Marshall
4,24,A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap!,6,Lily
4,24,Do not do that. Not cool.,6,All
4,24,I did it!,3,Marshall
4,24,"Honey, you did it!",4,Lily
4,24,I can do anything!,4,Marshall
4,24,It's true!,2,Lily
4,24,I bought a motorcycle!,4,Marshall
4,24,"No, not at all!",4,Lily
4,24,"OK, sorry. Come on, guys.",5,Marshall
4,24,"This is the year that I was left at the altar. The year I was a bartender tared Knocked The year I got fired. The year I got beat by a goat. A girl goat, and more. Yet it was the best year of my life. Because if this had not happened, I never had the best job of my life. But most importantly, I would not have met your mother, because as you know... It was in this class.Of course, this story is just beginning.",86,Ted (2030)

5,1,IN. TED'S CLASSROOM,3,2009
5,1,"Kids, on my first day as a college professor, there were two things I didn't know that I wish did. The first thing was that your mother was in that classroom.",31,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,"The second thing? Well, to explain that we have to go back to the beginning of the summer.",18,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,"When, after a year of wrestling with their feelings for each other, Barney and Robin finally, well...",17,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,Whoo!!!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Lily! All we need is your indoor &quot;whoo.&quot;,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Sorry.  Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this!",34,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, Lily, listen.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Barney's awesome.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Robin's more than just awe-&quot;some.&quot; She's awe-&quot;quite a bit.&quot; She's awe-&quot;a whole darn lot.&quot;,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Wait, what are you saying?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Oh yeah.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Is it something I did?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, It's us. You understand, right?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips.,34,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,I know. I Know. So... has the boat sailed on s*x tonight or...,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"After that, the summer went by way too fast. Until all of a sudden, it was the Friday before my first day as a college professor.",26,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,Wow! What's this?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favourite professor of all time.,21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,A fedora!  I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,You know what we should do? We should...,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,God... you just get me.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"OK, I should get going. I got a date.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,You're still seeing that guy?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Even better, seeing him naked.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,What!,1,<strong>Robin and Barney</strong>
5,1,"I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"OK Ted, You got first whip!",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"All right.  Hey, dummy . What did tell you about smoking in here?",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him!",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,I'm so sorry.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"It's just the whip's not a toy. There's such a thing as common sense, you know.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,You can whip me if you want.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"I will, some other time.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,Whoo!!!!!!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"So, how long has this been going on?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,All summer.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Wow, wow...",2,<strong>Barney and Robin</strong>
5,1,Girlfriend?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Slow your roll there, Lilypad.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, yeah.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,You've been together all summer. I don't get it.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,We should figure out what this is.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Yes, we should. Or. Or...",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,</em>,1,<em>And after having s*x
5,1,"Okay, now, we have to figure this out.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Yes, we do. Or. Or...",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.,15,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, &quot;I don't know.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"No, no, no . You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Or. Or...,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?&quot; I know the board says &quot;Professor Mosby,&quot; but to you I'm Ted.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,Question. Awesome. Hit it.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, here's my question, &quot;Ted,&quot; who the hell do you think you are?",13,<strong>Blond Girl</strong>
5,1,"Yeah Ted, we're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect.",13,<strong>A boy</strong>
5,1,"And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?",11,<strong>Another boy</strong>
5,1,They're at home. I...,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,And where are your pants?,5,<strong>Another girl</strong>
5,1,"Oh, God.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.",58,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Exactly.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Amen.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,You have to make things clear.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Run tell that.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Define the relationship.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Lily, can't you just let us be happy?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,And that's not happy?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Why? Give me one good reason.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,I'll give you 20...,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...",20,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"Euh, oh, hum, heu...",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,What do I have to do? Put a gun to your head? Buy you a six pack?,17,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Why not? You have a boyfriend?,6,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"No. No, no boyfriend.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Great! It's a date.,4,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,Hey Barn!,2,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,Hey Brad.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,I just thought of a reason.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game.",11,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Not really.,2,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Oh, man. Is this the talk?",6,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.",18,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"No, Brad, no, it's...",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.",22,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...",8,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says &quot;leap into it.&quot; My brain says &quot;it's a bad idea.&quot;",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.,9,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,We're not gonna have the talk.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have s*x afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,I don't think the talk is necessary.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,What?!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"Thank you, Ted.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Because Robin is already his girlfriend.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,What?!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,&quot;Gremlins&quot;?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,What about brunch? Is brunch cool?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!",14,<strong>Voice</strong>
5,1,"Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.",20,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,Why not? Lay it on me.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Hey Brad!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.",11,<strong>Brad</strong>
5,1,"Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,That's putting it a bit strongly.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make",16,<strong>Ted (2030 )</strong>
5,1,"Wait. Does professor have one &quot;F&quot; or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two &quot;F's&quot;. That looks right. I think that's right.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,We've been over this. Unless I say &quot;flugelhorn&quot; you haven't gone too far.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"No, I meant punching Brad.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,No.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Flugelhorn. Did you do this?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Ted, are you out there?",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Ted's not here, Robin.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Lily, let us out of here.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Lily! Come on. Let us out!,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,We are not having the talk!,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Then you'll die in there.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Hey, guys.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.,29,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,"Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here (showing girl's boobs). Okay, good luck. Byesies.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide.",18,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken",10,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,"I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom.",21,<strong>Blond girl</strong>
5,1,"Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.",18,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,Architect?,1,<strong>A girl</strong>
5,1,,0,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,Just hanging out? Not good enough.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Not good enough!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,Economics?,1,<strong>A boy</strong>
5,1,"Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.",28,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,&quot;We're seeing where things are going.&quot;,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Not good enough!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,You... Why do you want to be an architect?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,I don't want to be an architect.,7,<strong>Student</strong>
5,1,"Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,No questions!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"&quot;We're Barnman and Robin.&quot;  Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,Not... good enough.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Not good enough!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.",38,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats.",19,<strong>Other professor</strong>
5,1,"Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.",19,<strong>Professor</strong>
5,1,"Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.",7,<strong>Student</strong>
5,1,"Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.",40,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"That's awesome, Ted.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,"Congratulations, buddy.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,Thanks.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"Nice job, Ted.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"(from Robin's room) Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Yeah, I got you, buddy.  They still haven't had the talk?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,I think I know how to speed things up,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,Not cool!,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,"Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"I know, right?",3,Barney
5,1,Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clich√©, but... he really ruined me for other men.",33,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine",15,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,1,Maybe we should go back to being just friends.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Good. Me, neither.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Friends isn't gonna work.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,I know something we're good at.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Really?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,She can handle her Scotch.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,</strong> He's my boyfriend.,4,<strong>Robin
5,1,And she's my girlfriend.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,Good enough!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,1,She bought it.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,"You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,1,Flugelhorn?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,1,"</strong> Yeah, that felt wrong.",5,<strong>Robin
5,1,"You do realize they were lying, right?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,1,"No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,1,Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>

5,2,In this exact same restaurant.,5,<strong>Jen</strong>

5,2,"They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.",8,<strong>Jen</strong>

5,2,"Well, you've got your cats.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,2,Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.,13,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Huh. I had no idea.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?",14,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Huh. I had no idea.,5,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",41,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"We really are. Okay, I'm in.",6,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Great.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Where'd we go next?,4,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,I think we went to MacLaren's.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Okay.,1,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?",12,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.",10,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Tone down the kitty talk. Check.,6,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,You will not believe who we saw tonight.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,"Dude, um...",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,2,We saw the third doppelganger!,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like,15,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,2,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,Lesbian Robin.,2,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,2,"And Moustache Marshall. By the following summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that.",19,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>

5,2,Oh!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,So you went to a strip club?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,Busted.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,2,"Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.",40,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,So... Strip club.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,2,Marshall made me go.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,"All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.",15,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?",7,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Not really.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Really? I can't feel my fingers.,6,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.,26,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.",30,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?",14,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,See? Why didn't you lead off with that?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.,27,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,I'm not cool with it.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,2,Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,It's disgusting.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,2,Because it's harmless.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,Did one of your whores tell you that?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,2,"And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,Trouble? What trouble?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"It's, no, it's nothing.",4,<strong>Marshal</strong>l
5,2,"Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,"No, we're not.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,2,"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",50,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,2,"You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.",32,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,2,Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar),6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.",28,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,You loved them.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"They're family, Ted.",3,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly &quot;can't think&quot; of anything I do wrong.",28,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check,16,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,2,"Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,2,Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.,16,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Me?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Ted?,1,<strong>All the other</strong>
5,2,Yeah. We were all sitting over there...,7,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...",20,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,What about Cat Woman?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Yeah, that would've been good.",5,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Psst! Ted!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,2,Nice.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Nice.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,We were checking out Moustache Marshall.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,Ah...,1,<strong>The other</strong>

5,2,"&quot;Present you&quot; isn't so bad, either.",6,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Thank you very much.,4,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,You got it.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.",6,<strong>Jen</strong>

5,2,"Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.",9,<strong>Jen</strong>

5,2,"Me, too.",2,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,I remember now.,3,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,Wow.,1,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,2,"Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.",35,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.",37,<strong>Marhsall</strong>
5,2,"All right, we got to fix this.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.",25,<strong>Lily</strong>

5,2,"Wow, she crawls fast.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,2,"Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24.

I've learned a lot tonight.",60,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,2,"The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.",32,<strong>Jen</strong>
5,2,"No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what",37,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,3,"Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,Mm-hmm.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate, sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing.",28,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,3,He's cheating on me.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,What?!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Well, that doesn't prove anything.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase).,21,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,And what do you plan on doing with it?,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.",35,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,There's a basement storage area?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"Oh, that's great, honey.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,What the hell is that?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,Barrel resin?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Just go with it.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,So you need a hand throwing it out?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"The Bermuda Triangle was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny.",34,<strong>Ted ( 2030)</strong>
5,3,This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.,25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Be cool, baby. Damn!  See you, sweetie. Good luck.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"Bye, babe.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"Now, can we please get out of here?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,Yeah. I'll grab my coat.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Oops.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,A college notebook?!,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb. &quot;Birthday",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face!,19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight?",62,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,"What do you know about this,Marshall?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Well...,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>

5,3,"Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,Okay.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>

5,3,"Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,Okay.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>

5,3,Right. The most important facial expression of all.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,Whoa...,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point",43,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,3,One. &quot;Vancouver Canucks 2004 Division Title.&quot;,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"What?! That's not distracting. That's just talking about the story of a scrappy little underdog team that prevailed despite very shaky goal ending and, frankly, the declining skills of Trevor Linden.",31,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Two,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"You have to clean your gun. My uncle had a filthy old shotgun, blew both his thumbs off trying to shoot a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob.",40,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,3,"Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call &quot;touchy-feely.&quot; She doesn't say, &quot;I love you,&quot; like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, &quot;You're an idiot.&quot;",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,&quot;You're an idiot&quot;?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say &quot;I love you,&quot; she's already broken up with you in her mind.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,3,"Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor?  Or should I turn it up for you? .",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"It may not have been a thumbs-up, kids.",8,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>

5,3,Trick question. Get her butterscotch.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,Correct! Why?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,Correct! What is Robin's dream job?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad",36,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"&quot;Oh, Captain! My Captain!&quot;",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,How good was Dead Poet's Society?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"I know, right? The end? Tears.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, &quot;I am proud of you, eh?&quot;",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,So why are you crying now?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,3,I'm not crying.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"Oh, stop it.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6,12,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,3,That's right now.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?",30,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,3,"Dude, it's a barrel!",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Aw! You're giving Mabel away?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? .,21,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,&quot;Auditing&quot;?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning.",10,<strong>Shin-Ya</strong>
5,3,"You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,,0,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,3,"You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,3,</strong>  Oh. Yeah...,3,<strong>Robin
5,3,Don't wanna leave out the righty.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,3,Noted.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,That was a lie?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,We had just started dating. I was being nice.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.",28,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.",48,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,What do you want?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.,17,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?",56,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,"I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.",57,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,3,"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.  But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small",48,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,You're an idiot.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,You know...,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,Hmm?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,3,"That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,3,And your work address.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>

5,4,You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,4,Right?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,Who was that?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,4,"Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.",42,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"Uh, no, it doesn't.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,Westchester. Why?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,You're the sexless innkeeper.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,4,What the hell is &quot;the sexless innkeeper&quot;?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?",36,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,Not really.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, &quot;where do you live?&quot;And she said, &quot;one block south.&quot;. I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",118,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,No way.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,4,"Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,4,We have. Go on.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,4,Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!,14,<strong>Lily</strong>

5,4,"Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,4,"And then on Sunday, we're up at 6",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,4,"Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.",59,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,4,"Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,4,What's going on?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,4,"Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,4,I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,4,"If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.",38,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,4,"Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,4,"One thing?  One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?",40,<strong>Marshall</strong>

5,4,"Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,"To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,4,"Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,You're right.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,4,Thank you.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,4,All that sexlessness has made you wise.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,5,"Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?",16,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,5,"And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American.",15,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,5,I want to say- Jefferson?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,Correct.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,Oh!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the &quot;Hey, Vern&quot; guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,Look who's back from the wishing well.,7,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,5,"It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,5,"All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?",19,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,5,And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.,14,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,5,We'd love cornmeal body scrub!,5,<strong>Marshall and Lily</strong>
5,5,Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. <em></em> Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. <em></em> *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*",73,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"Hey, man.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,Shh.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,17,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,Chicago.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,*And I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more...*,12,<strong><em>singing</em></strong>
5,5,"Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"If she's pissed, she's pissed.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,Pfft.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.",13,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,5,Good morning.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,You went Canadian.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,How Canadian?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,This Canadian. <em></em> Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"How did you find me, anyway?",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Barney, I'm not taking the test.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"God, you're still drunk.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",44,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,Kind of cross.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,Just like old times!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.,8,<strong>Man</strong>
5,5,Cornmeal...,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,5,I can't believe you guys are closing.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.,11,<strong>Man</strong>
5,5,It's like an entire country without a tailor.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Yeah, give me two coffees.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"$3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?",12,<strong>Women</strong>
5,5,What game?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.,10,<strong>Women</strong>
5,5,"Oh, I guess I missed it.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change.",7,<strong>Women</strong>
5,5,I'm not American.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot; for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.,22,<strong>Women</strong>
5,5,What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,18,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,I don't want this anymore.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,We shouldn't have left Lily.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, &quot;I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!&quot;",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,What exactly is &quot;Ted's fault&quot;?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,That is not true.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",50,<strong>Robin</strong>

For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.",121,<strong>Kenny</strong>
5,5,"I'm sorry, ted!",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,"I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",13,<strong>Ted</strong>

5,5,"Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"Hells, yeah!",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,Or listen to the Sparky book again?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,Listen to the Sparky book again.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,5,Okay. Let's listen to it again.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,5,"Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",55,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, &quot;Yeah, America's cool.&quot;",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,Hmm.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, &quot;Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too.&quot; I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",38,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,5,"Wait, you can do that?",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,5,"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,6,I think that's true.,4,Robin
5,6,I told you.,3,Barney
5,6,Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.,24,Ted

5,6,"You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal.

5,6,"The days of Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever. (At the bar, Barney and Robin dance) and Marshall and Lily have continued to argue.",27,Ted (2030)
5,6,"I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.",19,Marshall
5,6,"Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.",21,Lily
5,6,I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.,16,Marshall
5,6,You will perhaps have to do it again.,8,Lily
5,6,And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick.,11,Ted (2030)
5,6,"I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.",35,Marshall
5,6,It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.,10,Ted
5,6,"Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.",19,Marshall
5,6,"You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.",25,Ted
5,6,"Thank you, Robbie Engineering.",4,Ted
5,6,I do not like nicknames.,5,Robin
5,6,"You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?",7,Ted
5,6,"Seriously, stop.",2,Robin
5,6,It's T-Mose.,2,Ted
5,6,I do not like with you either.,7,Robin
5,6,"Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.",13,Marshall
5,6,T-Mose was great. I think of the show.,8,Ted
5,6,The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.,9,Marshall
5,6,They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.,9,Ted
5,6,"And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.",14,Ted (2030)
5,6,How will Marshall and Lily?,5,Barney
5,6,"Those two worry me, really.",5,Robin
5,6,"You and your big, huge heart.",6,Barney
5,6,Enough. The game is over.,5,Ted
5,6,What do you mean by that?,6,Barney
5,6,"Who, him?",2,Robin
5,6,"It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too &quot;surnomants&quot;. It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.",31,Ted
5,6,How would you know that?,5,Robin
5,6,Phil told me.,3,Ted
5,6,Who the hell is Phil?,5,Barney
5,6,Your downstairs neighbor.,3,Ted
5,6,I'm Phil. 12-B.,3,Man
5,6,And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?,17,Ted
5,6,All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,15,Barney
5,6,I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.,21,Barney
5,6,It's your board that is zero.,6,Robin
5,6,You're on the side of Lily? You...  No. We will argue and I can not spin.,16,Barney
5,6,I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.,10,Robin
5,6,Or so I tried the jump?,6,Barney
5,6,Or just the pants?,4,Robin
5,6,This trick of dodging is over?,6,Barney
5,6,I think.,2,Robin
5,6,You have the? This is the smallest!,7,Barney
5,6,They fight because of you!?,5,Robin
5,6,And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.,10,Barney
5,6,All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.,13,Robin
5,6,The tie murdered by Robin.,5,Barney
5,6,The hidden camera in the headboard.,6,Robin
5,6,"As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.",23,Barney
5,6,Barney for the millionth time...,5,Robin
5,6,I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!,11,Ted
5,6,"Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.",14,Barney
5,6,It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.,11,Robin
5,6,I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.,12,Ted
5,6,Stop it.,2,Robin
5,6,"Marshall, dinner is ready.",4,Lily
5,6,You've done for me?,4,Marshall
5,6,"No, but what is your favorite.",6,Lily
5,6,We need advice.,3,Barney
5,6,"Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland.",21,Ted (2030)
5,6,"And in the end, Lily and Marshall had the same reaction.",11,Ted (2030)
5,6,I'll do the dishes directly to my death.,8,Marshall
5,6,"I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak.",21,Lily
5,6,"Sure, honey.",2,Marshall
5,6,I love you.,3,Lily
5,6,I love you too.,4,Marshall
5,6,"You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?",12,Robin
5,6,I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.,11,Marshall
5,6,And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.,18,Lily
5,6,More important than winning.,4,Barney
5,6,"Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?",7,Robin
5,6,"The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part.",20,Lily
5,6,Good night.,2,Robin
5,6,What about now?,3,Barney
5,6,I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.,12,Robin
5,6,"Or, there is a bench in the elevator.",8,Barney
5,6,"That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?",13,Robin
5,6,Grave. It's not a competition.,5,Barney
5,6,We won!,2,Lily
5,6,Best couple of the world!,5,Marshall
5,6,Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.,18,Marshall
5,6,You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.,11,Lily

5,7,This is obvious.,3,Marshall
5,7,What does that mean?,4,Barney
5,7,"Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.",9,Marshall
5,7,What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.,9,Barney

If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!",97,Barney

5,7,We're sure he had done?,5,Lily

5,7,"No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin.",13,Lily
5,7,But over time I began to notice things. Barney and Robin have stopped their crazy adventures.,16,Ted (2030)

5,7,Shut up.,2,Robin
5,7,But it got worse... more,5,Ted (2030)

5,7,"Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old.",18,Ted
5,7,My favorite cop show.,4,Marshall
5,7,This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.,24,Ted
5,7,They are perfect together.,4,Lily
5,7,It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.,18,Ted
5,7,We are two dominant sets.,5,Marshall
5,7,"Of course, my heart.",4,Lily
5,7,"If they are not happy, why not break?",8,Marshall
5,7,They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.,22,Ted
5,7,I think the first who plays Barney deflates.,8,Marshall
5,7,It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say &quot;selfish&quot; nicely?,21,Lily
5,7,Independents. Every relationship goes through there.,6,Lily

5,7,"Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?",16,Barney
5,7,"I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?",15,Marshall
5,7,Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!,10,Barney
5,7,So you're happy?,3,Marshall
5,7,"Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, &quot;Every moment is a battle.&quot;",22,Barney
5,7,So you're happy?,3,Marshall
5,7,And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.,22,Barney
5,7,"Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.",15,Barney
5,7,Okay. Decides that the piece.,5,Robin

5,7,Face.,1,Robin
5,7,It's face.,2,Barney
5,7,"s*x... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?",13,Barney
5,7,We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.,25,Marshall
5,7,What next?,2,Ted
5,7,We will release... the Kraken.,5,Marshall
5,7,"Children, as you know, earlier this year I learned that Lily had broken no one, not two, but seven of my past relationships.",23,Ted (2030)
5,7,Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.,8,Lily
5,7,But you're the best.,4,Marshall

5,7,No need for it. We can do it alone.,9,Ted

5,7,"If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.",20,Ted

5,7,A surveillance van.,3,Marshall
5,7,What?,1,Ted
5,7,"It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, &quot;That's not why I signed,&quot; or stuff like that.",22,Marshall
5,7,The server arrives.,3,Ted
5,7,"Please, shut up.",3,Robin
5,7,What?,1,Barney
5,7,"I thought you had mentioned, sorry.  This is an engagement ring?Are you...?",12,Robin
5,7,"No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?",16,Barney
5,7,We're committed to one another.,5,Robin
5,7,Your business is already in my apartment.,7,Barney
5,7,Easier for taxes.,3,Robin

5,7,What next?,2,Marshall
5,7,"They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends.",38,Lily

5,9,He wanted me to pay rent. It has ended badly.,10,Mickey
5,9,You should pay rent to live in the basement of your parents.,12,Lily
5,9,It's not my first choice. With the old schnoques up there it's a little disturbing. They do not understand the trick of the sock on the handle.,27,Mickey
5,9,They surprised you with a girl?,6,Marshall
5,9,In a sense.,3,Mickey
5,9,Working? You are retired.,4,Lily
5,9,Now that I have another mouth to feed I had to return to the mill. Where is my truss?,19,Grandfather

5,9,"Just the time to share my games with my Aldrin limitless SENSAS last game ', &quot;Fighting dogs&quot;.",17,Mickey
5,9,"And Lily threw a glance at her father that Marshall had seen only a few times. A look that we all pray not to receive, his eyes &quot;You're dead to me.&quot;",31,Ted (2030)

5,9,Tell me which of you is going to slap me!,10,Barney
5,9,What?,1,Ted
5,9,"I die, I, here. Ted takes a chip, I jump! Robin arranges her hair, I jump! I jump all the time. It's bad for my skin. It gives me wrinkles. Wrinkles!",31,Barney
5,9,"Lily, go. It's been 3 years. This is long enough.",10,Marshall

5,9,"OK (She leaves the grocery store, coffee in hand. In his bed while sleeping Marshall)... You dirty b*st*rd!  It was not decaf!",22,Lily
5,9,"I've supported with these unknowns, but it's your father, okay? We can at least give him some turkey?",18,Marshall
5,9,No.,1,Lily
5,9,"Go. Please, I can not ask him to leave at Thanksgiving.",11,Marshall
5,9,"You did not ask. Tell him it's just important that it is here. In less than two, it will be a games convention in Toledo, to give money to your dental apparatus in a so-called Milton Bradley.",37,Lily
5,9,He was trying to earn money to feed his family.,10,Marshall
5,9,"No, that's what mom was doing with his two jobs. This man broke my heart every day for 20 years.",20,Lily
5,9,So we can give pieces of chicken not cooked.,9,Marshall

5,9,I say I'll slap.,4,Robin
5,9,"What, so it's... the end of the discussion?",8,Ted
5,9,You said I could slap.,5,Robin
5,9,"I was polite. If someone will slap, it will be me.",11,Ted
5,9,"No, not at all.",4,Robin
5,9,This is interesting.,3,Barney
5,9,It's your family. And I'm sorry but we do not separate the family.,13,Marshall
5,9,"It's easy for you to say that, you come to the family the most ridiculously close to the world.",19,Lily
5,9,It is not ridiculously close.,5,Marshall

5,9,"I always thought it would arrange the marriage. I even wrote a speech. But hey, not invited '. Thin, I have not even seen the wedding photo.",27,Mickey
5,9,"And right before my eyes, your father broke down in tears. (Actually, it's Marshall who starts crying) Stop it! You come to Thanksgiving!",23,Marshall
5,9,You've invited?!,2,Lily
5,9,"The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified.",20,Marshall
5,9,I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that?,13,Lily
5,9,You and I are married. So it is also part of my family. Enter.,14,Marshall
5,9,"Ted, you should play quickly. Your gallbladder is about to explode.",11,Mickey
5,9,It must be half an hour. We should get Lily.,10,Marshall

5,9,"I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women.",15,Barney
5,9,Do not listen. It's decided.,5,Ted
5,9,"And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps.",85,Barney
5,9,Leads to me!,3,Robin
5,9,Robin! Pull yourself together! (The timer sounds and &quot;something sprung from the game) What just happened?,16,Ted

5,9,"And at that time, Marshall is launching a look at Mickey none of us had ever seen.",17,Ted (2030)
5,9,What is it? It does what?,6,Mickey
5,9,You have swallowed this painting?,5,Ted
5,9,This is my look &quot;you're dead to me.&quot;,8,Marshall
5,9,"Yeah, Lily does it better...",5,Mickey
5,9,Get out of my house!,5,Marshall
5,9,"In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again.  What? Baby, what has happened?",61,Marshall
5,9,"Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father.",69,Lily
5,9,"And that's the way to Thanksgiving 2009, your aunt Lily was a miracle. (Lily and Marshall arrive at the door of their apartment, when Mickey's father, Lily, was released. She throws herself into his arms) It has brought a man to life.",42,Ted (2030)

5,9,It's gonna be Ted.,4,Robin
5,9,What? Why me?,3,Ted
5,9,"Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can.",37,Robin
5,9,Thank you.,2,Ted
5,9,This is the worst.,4,Barney
5,9,"You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Barney are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?",36,Ted
5,9,Yes,1,Robin

5,9,"So, I want to move. Mickey?",6,Robin
5,9,No way!,2,Barney
5,9,"I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap.",24,Robin
5,9,"Really? It's a bit weird for me, I just met Barney and I have nothing against him but how many times have we a chance to slap someone in the face?",31,Mickey

5,9,"No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!",16,Barney
5,9,The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.,8,Lily
5,9,It's not good. Please... Let me...,6,Barney
5,9,Close your eyes. It will soon be over.,8,Lily
5,9,I'm running in a meadow.,5,Barney
5,9,I can not do it. Why I can not do it?,11,Lily
5,9,Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.,32,Marshall
5,9,Stop your bullshit.,3,Barney
5,9,And so... there will not slap... of... today.,8,Marshall

5,13,We're friends.,2,Robin
5,13,The cow! Robin Scherbatsky is friends with my art teacher.,10,Scotty
5,13,This is architecture. Go will study.,6,Ted
5,13,"And a second, you're &quot;Big caramel&quot;?",6,Scotty
5,13,Go!,1,Ted
5,13,Hello?,1,Marshall
5,13,"Hey baby, I go up there.",6,Lily
5,13,"What, why?",2,Marshall
5,13,"There was a problem at school, it was therefore the day. I thought to visit you, eat something with a nice little dessert.",23,Lily
5,13,"I have a problem, it was my wife. The first time I spoke to you, she thought you were a man, so...",22,Marshall
5,13,... then you're afraid she became insane upon learning that I am a woman.,14,Jenkins
5,13,Absolutely.,1,Marshall
5,13,"Good God, I was in a band improv. Am what I do.",12,Jenkins
5,13,"Hello, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.",5,Lily
5,13,"Hi Lily, I am of the French Embassy. I am here because of a little problem with cheese but important.",20,Jenkins
5,13,It is Jenkins.,3,Marshall
5,13,You are Jenkins?,3,Lily
5,13,"Yes, well, uh, I'll let you sort it out between you, see you later.",14,Jenkins
5,13,Marshall cracked. The moment he feared.,6,Ted (2030)
5,13,"The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat?",12,Lily
5,13,"Wait, you're not jealous at all?",6,Marshall
5,13,"Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman.",12,Lily
5,13,"Because we love to madness, right?",6,Marshall
5,13,Yes of course. Let's eat.,5,Lily
5,13,It was not jealous at all.,6,Marshall
5,13,"Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.",13,Ted
5,13,What is this supposed to mean?,6,Marshall
5,13,"That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.",12,Robin
5,13,"Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.",24,Ted
5,13,"I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.",31,Marshall
5,13,"That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.",29,Robin
5,13,"No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.",17,Marshall
5,13,"Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.",10,Robin
5,13,What?,1,Marshall
5,13,Try your luck.,3,Robin
5,13,"So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V.  Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?",23,Ted
5,13,"I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee",15,Robin
5,13,"It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.",10,Ted
5,13,"Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work.",11,Robin
5,13,"No, it is not.",4,Ted
5,13,"Come on, stand New York.",5,Robin
5,13,I watch your show all the time.,7,Student
5,13,"Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?",12,Robin
5,13,"Thank you for last, Robin.",5,Ted
5,13,"That night, great show on poisons. (She goes out, then reopens the door) Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9.",33,Robin
5,13,"Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.",22,Ted
5,13,The truth is that we look for the drinking game.,10,Scotty
5,13,The what?,2,Ted
5,13,"As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says &quot;But um&quot;.",25,Student
5,13,But huh?,2,Barney
5,13,"But um, it would seem, she often said.",8,Ted
5,13,"It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...",19,Barney
5,13,It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.,11,Ted
5,13,"Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said &quot;But um&quot; so often?",21,Barney
5,13,"Tonight, we saw how much she often said.",8,Ted (2030)
5,13,"It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?",14,Robin
5,13,"No, the third.",3,Boy
5,13,Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...,7,Robin
5,13,Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.,17,Marshall
5,13,Let me see.,3,Lily
5,13,"It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?",23,Marshall
5,13,I think sometimes it's the case.,6,Lily
5,13,But not for us?,4,Marshall
5,13,"No, of course not.",4,Lily
5,13,"Sure. Imagine, you have a gun to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.",19,Marshall
5,13,"I would say this is me, this is what is right.",11,Lily
5,13,"Now, the gun is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.",27,Marshall
5,13,"No, no weak or strong.",5,Lily
5,13,So this...,2,Marshall
5,13,"It went on for a while, until finally...",8,Ted (2030)
5,13,"Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered",39,Marshall
5,13,And Oprah has tried everything?,5,Lily
5,13,Everything you need to decide now.,6,Marshall
5,13,"I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.",11,Lily
5,13,How can you say such a thing!,7,Marshall
5,13,"She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.",22,Marshall
5,13,"Easy, that's the plan",4,Barney
5,13,"Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?",18,Ted
5,13,"Yes, an ordinary night for the &quot;Big caramel.&quot;",8,Marshall
5,13,Do you think she was flirting with me?,8,Marshall
5,13,Bluntly.,1,Ted
5,13,"Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the &quot;Big caramel&quot;... may move, ok let me try again.",28,Marshall
5,13,"Okay, I understand.",3,Ted
5,13,"Ted, I have a great idea.",6,Robin
5,13,Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.,18,Ted
5,13,"If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn.",27,Robin
5,13,"Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.",19,Ted
5,13,"Look, just because your class prefers me to you...",9,Robin
5,13,... You're a drinking game.,5,Ted
5,13,What?,1,Robin
5,13,"That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say &quot;But um&quot;, they take a shot.",20,Ted
5,13,But umm?,2,Robin
5,13,Yes.,1,Ted
5,13,"I'm not But um, I never told But hum.",9,Robin
5,13,"So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.",40,Ted
5,13,Hey Jenkins!,2,Marshall
5,13,Hey buddy!,2,Jenkins
5,13,"So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean...",41,Marshall
5,13,"Hey baby, what do you do at home?",8,Lily
5,13,"Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve.",10,Marshall
5,13,What?,1,Lily
5,13,"Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak.",14,Lily
5,13,You're sure it's not a fever?,6,Marshall
5,13,You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins.,12,Lily
5,13,"I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth.",18,Marshall
5,13,Of course it was.,4,Lily
5,13,It was silky... and hard as a branch of starfish,10,Marshall
5,13,"I'm so jealous, I'll go see it and hit right on the nose... like an old sandwich. Come on baby, you want some soup?",24,Lily
5,13,It happened! Have you... meatballs?,5,Marshall
5,13,And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions?,30,Ted
5,13,You want to come to the bar with us tonight?,10,Scotty
5,13,What?,1,Ted
5,13,"Yeah, we wanted to do some of Robin Scherbatsky, if you want to come?",14,Scotty
5,13,"Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay?",17,Ted
5,13,"So, your third book is your new novel, but um...",10,Robin
5,13,But hum!,2,the student bar
5,13,"sh1t! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly?",14,Robin
5,13,"Oh, it's true!",3,Man
5,13,But umm...,2,Robin
5,13,But hum!,2,All
5,13,It's not pretty!,3,Ted
5,13,And that's when that Robin had an idea that would end the game forever.,14,Ted (2030)
5,13,"I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um...",13,Robin
5,13,But hum!,2,All
5,13,"And tonight, you had to, but um...",7,Robin
5,13,But hum!,2,All
5,13,"For a long time, but um...",6,Robin
5,13,But hum!,2,All
5,13,"No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap!",9,Ted
5,13,"I think I should go, keep your $ 10!",9,Man
5,13,"Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um...",21,Robin
5,13,"We should drink professor, is the rule! She said but um.",11,Scotty
5,13,"My God, help us all!",5,Ted
5,13,Oh you're here! I'm really sorry to have embraced yesterday.,10,Jenkins
5,13,It's nothing.,2,Marshall
5,13,And I'm sorry I slept with you in the mail room.,11,Jenkins
5,13,It was not me!,4,Marshall
5,13,"Oh my God, that's embarrassing 2 discussions today. I do not do usually, I was totally stuffed.",17,Jenkins
5,13,You were drunk at 8am?,5,Marshall
5,13,"Yeah, I know not what has happened!",7,Jenkins
5,13,The police officer was unharmed but um...,7,Robin
5,13,But hum!  I gotta work!,5,Jenkins
5,13,Happy to have you helped you remember.,7,Marshall
5,13,"Damn, how I could do that!",6,Jenkins
5,13,It's nothing!,2,Marshall
5,13,"No, you know what it is not nothing. You are the coolest guy in the office that stupid. And I really do not want to spoil our friendship. This is so embarrassing, do not tell anyone please.",37,Jenkins
5,13,"No, who am I to say? Lily? I said to Lily.",11,Marshall
5,13,"For heaven's sake, I have to go talk to him, I must apologize!",13,Jenkins
5,13,"No, no!",2,Marshall
5,13,"If Marshall, I must say that it happened, it meant nothing... And I'm sorry.",14,Jenkins
5,13,"No, I... Yes! Yes! Do it!",6,Marshall
5,13,I'm going.,2,Jenkins
5,13,"And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.",51,Marshall
5,13,"So Lily, what I'm saying is that... It happened and I feel terrible. And I am truly sorry.",18,Jenkins
5,13,"Well, it happened! What will we do? It happened!Terrible, like you said. It happened!",14,Marshall
5,13,"Exactly, I feel bad and I hate myself. If what I have done you got injured or affected your relationship with Marshall, forgive me!",24,Jenkins
5,13,Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me.,15,Lily
5,13,"Marshall, you're in the field!",5,Barney
5,13,"Children, your Uncle Marshall was never tried again to make your aunt Lily jealous.",14,Ted (2030)
5,13,Lil '? It's good!,4,Marshall
5,13,So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise!,13,Ted
5,13,How's you all?,3,Robin
5,13,"No, no, no, please. Just goes away!",7,Ted

5,14,Many people bite their nails. Others tap their feet.And others imagine themselves to be interviewed by renowned sports commentator Jim Nantz.,21,Ted (2030)
5,14,"Hi friends, any sport has had its icon, which it excels. Ali was boxing, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with bombs snuff chance, my next guest, Mr Barney Stinson.Barney, welcome.",33,Jim
5,14,"Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.",11,Barney
5,14,"It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.",59,Jim
5,14,"Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary.",6,Barney
5,14,It all started when I decided to start a small challenge.,11,Barney
5,14,Oh my God. Wow.,4,Marshall
5,14,He decides his victim.,4,Ted
5,14,Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off!,17,Barney
5,14,Hi!,1,Marshall
5,14,Hi!,1,Robin
5,14,How did it go with Dale?,6,Lily
5,14,"You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.",33,Robin
5,14,"Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future.",24,Lily
5,14,The Yeti is not fictitious.,5,Marshall
5,14,That was fast.,3,from seeing Barney
5,14,"So, the first night was pretty normal.",7,Jim
5,14,"Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack.",10,Barney
5,14,Respect. Which brings us to the second night.,8,Jim
5,14,"That brings us to the second night. You see the bomb that pampers its Black Russian ? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me.",38,Barney
5,14,"Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?",14,Robin
5,14,How do you know he'll call?,6,Marshall
5,14,"How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.",23,Robin
5,14,"And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.",35,Ted

5,14,Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...,11,Ted

5,14,Of course not!,3,Lily
5,14,There is no such Bizarros who share everything.,8,Marshall
5,14,Of course I do.,4,Robin
5,14,That's exactly what you are.,5,Ted
5,14,It is perfectly normal.,4,Lily
5,14,What's happening guys?,3,Robin

5,14,"It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out.",19,Lily

5,14,"Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one.",7,Robin
5,14,"Wow. 3 girls in 3 nights. This is gross, even from Barney.",12,Lily
5,14,Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...,11,Ted
5,14,Do not tell! You're going to jinx him!,8,Marshall
5,14,Wear what bad luck?,4,Lily
5,14,I had left to do... flawless.,6,Barney
5,14,"It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection.",9,Barney
5,14,"Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder.",15,Jim
5,14,Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.,17,Barney
5,14,"It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield...",31,Jim
5,14,You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.,12,Barney
5,14,"... takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating.",32,Jim
5,14,"I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends.",16,Barney
5,14,Jen has not come into being today.,7,Ted

5,14,Wait a second. Want it called?,6,Lily
5,14,No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?,16,Robin
5,14,Yeah. When did you start doing that too?,8,Ted
5,14,"It's been years! You had to know, you lived with us.",11,Marshall
5,14,"Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird.",15,Ted
5,14,We kept her in the bathroom.,6,Lily
5,14,"No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.",12,Ted
5,14,"Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?",15,Robin
5,14,Oh my god!,3,Marshall
5,14,Finish me!,2,Ted
5,14,I'm having so much!,4,Robin

5,14,Like a charm. As all week.,6,Ted
5,14,Yeah? Hard to believe.,4,Marshall
5,14,Why?,1,Ted
5,14,"Apparently, this big merger last week went wrong, and Barney wears the hat.",13,Marshall
5,14,"Oh, it's weird. He said nothing.",6,Lily
5,14,"Even I who works with him, I just learned this afternoon when I walked past the office of his boss.",20,Marshall
5,14,"... what it has cost this company, Stinson?!",8,Pattern
5,14,I never thought about Barney so scared.,7,Marshall
5,14,I think he'll get fired.,5,Marshall
5,14,I can not believe that Barney is going to get fired.,11,Ted
5,14,"Yeah, they have a meeting Friday to see if he keeps his job or not.",15,Marshall
5,14,Poor guy. It must pinball.,5,Robin
5,14,I'll go talk to him.,5,Lily
5,14,No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what.,13,Ted
5,14,"Come on, it's his career. This is much more important than a stupid without...",14,Lily
5,14,"Ahh! Okay. You can lick my hand all you want, I will not let you ruin... Ouch!",17,Marshall
5,14,It must go talk to him.,6,Lily
5,14,I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.,8,Ted
5,14,Hey!,1,Barney
5,14,Is everything okay?,3,Ted
5,14,Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you.,16,Barney

I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, &quot;Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. &quot; So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary.

5,16,"Well, I do not think it will work out between us. For now.",13,Tiffany
5,16,And that's when it hit me. I was at his hook. I also realized...,14,Ted (2030)
5,16,"You've missed so much, baby.",5,Tiffany
5,16,Tiffany was to hook this guy. It was a vicious circle.Henrietta was my hook. And years later I learned that this poor guy was on the hook of Henrietta.,29,Ted (2030)
5,16,You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done.  And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.,29,Ted
5,16,I can do it alone.,5,Lily
5,16,So prove it. And... take me a pudding.,8,Marshall
5,16,"Listen, Scooter. There is no way we ever be together.",10,Lily
5,16,Right now! I'm sorry but he is adorable.,8,Marshall
5,16,Listen. I want to be with you.,7,Lily
5,16,So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.,10,Marshall
5,16,Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?,28,Barney
5,16,There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.,13,Robin
5,16,I want you to meet the latest arrival.,8,Woman
5,16,Nice to meet you. I represent statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.,11,Woman 2

5,16,You're a little dramatic.,4,Robin
5,16,"Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!",41,Barney
5,16,So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook.,16,Ted (2030)

5,16,"Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.",18,Ted
5,16,Right now?,2,Henrietta

5,16,Another tour.,2,Mike
5,16,It can wait.,3,Robin
5,16,How are you?,3,Robin
5,16,You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?,15,Ted
5,16,I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.,66,Barney

5,17,It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.,18,Lily
5,17,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.",9,Marshall
5,17,"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.",38,Barney
5,17,"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word &quot;s*x&quot;?",50,Ted

5,17,She did it too!,4,Barney
5,17,"And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, &quot;I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? &quot;",52,Ted
5,17,"You try this sh1t of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.",13,Barney

5,17,"Robin, you okay?",3,Don
5,17,"I just have a cold. That's why for my voice.  But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.",37,Marshall
5,17,But what are you doing?,5,Robin
5,17,"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",23,Marshall
5,17,I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan,30,Barney

5,17,You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?,12,Lily
5,17,It was my show.,4,Robin
5,17,"But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...",14,Robin
5,17,"I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is &quot;no.&quot;By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining.",30,Anita
5,17,"Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.",39,Robin

5,17,I have not really want right now.,7,Robin
5,17,You were broken heart?,4,Anita
5,17,"And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...",17,Robin
5,17,"That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it.",14,Anita
5,17,That's to say?,3,Robin
5,17,I will use the power of &quot;no&quot; to destroy your friend Barney.Say it.,13,Anita

5,17,"It's done.  Thank you, Mike.",5,Anita
5,17,"I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the shooting range.",37,Robin
5,17,I hope this was not the same nights.,8,Lily
5,17,"Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.",7,Robin
5,17,You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.,13,Marshall
5,17,"You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.",16,Lily
5,17,She cried? Real tears? It means...,6,Marshall
5,17,Marshall understood what he had been con with Robin.,9,Ted (2030)

5,17,There is another option... but you're not ready.,8,Ted
5,17,Tell me.,2,Barney
5,17,"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",41,Ted
5,17,A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,14,Barney
5,17,"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.",10,Ted
5,17,Okay.,1,Barney
5,17,Let me do it. I will plan everything.,8,Ted
5,17,You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?,10,Barney
5,17,Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...,12,Ted
5,17,What are you doing?,4,Barney
5,17,You just gotta make him understand...,6,Ted singing
5,17,They look at us.,4,Barney
5,17,How important it is for you...,6,Ted
5,17,Really? You really gonna do that?,6,Barney
5,17,"In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him.

5,17,"Finally, the night of the great rencards arrived.",8,Ted (2030)
5,17,Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.,20,Marshall
5,17,I just... I canceled.,4,Robin
5,17,How does it... Wait.,4,Marshall
5,17,A problem?,2,Lily
5,17,Robin canceled his hot date.,5,Marshall
5,17,What? She was super excited there is one hour.,9,Ted
5,17,You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.,11,Ted
5,17,Thank you.,2,Robin
5,17,You're excited to go out with Don?,7,Ted
5,17,You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.,9,Robin
5,17,"I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at &quot;Tombeur panties.&quot; They call it a super hot date.",45,Ted
5,17,Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!,14,Marshall
5,17,She seemed happy after the break.,6,Ted
5,17,You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.,11,Marshall
5,17,"Wait, but that would mean...",5,Ted
5,17,And I understood what I had been con with Robin.,10,Ted (2030)
5,17,You sing what?,3,Ted
5,17,A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.,12,Marshall
5,17,I'll sing a verse.,4,Ted
5,17,Super.,1,Marshall
5,17,Where is she?,3,Ted
5,17,I think it is the toilet.,6,Marshall
5,17,"I'm fine, I'm fine.",4,Robin
5,17,Why did you do that?,5,Barney
5,17,"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.",20,Marshall
5,17,Why are you angry against me?,6,Barney
5,17,You were a real asshole to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.,15,Ted
5,17,The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.,12,Barney
5,17,You see nothing.,3,Ted
5,17,Typical of a guy.,4,Marshall
5,17,"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.",11,Lily
5,17,"What, she is upset?",4,Barney
5,17,"Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.",10,Lily
5,17,Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.,18,Ted (2030)
5,17,You should have seen.,4,Barney
5,17,I'm going.,2,Robin
5,17,We go back home...,4,Barney
5,17,I can not believe that Robin is upset.,8,Barney
5,17,And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.,9,Marshall
5,17,I did worse after the premiere of &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot;It's been like that since we broke up?,17,Barney
5,17,"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.",25,Lily
5,17,I know where.,3,Barney
5,17,"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.",11,Robin
5,17,I know you're upset.,4,Barney
5,17,"What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.",26,Robin
5,17,You sure you're not upset?,5,Barney
5,17,Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?,23,Robin
5,17,You're not another number for me.,6,Barney
5,17,"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.",30,Robin
5,17,"I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?",27,Barney
5,17,"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.",10,Robin
5,17,"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.",10,Barney
5,17,Do not sleep with Anita.,5,Robin
5,17,I promise.,2,Barney
5,17,Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?,14,Robin
5,17,It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.,13,Barney
5,17,"Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.",26,Ted (2030)
5,17,I wanted to call you.,5,Barney
5,17,"I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?",22,Anita
5,17,"I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.",14,Barney
5,17,"I see. You try the trick of &quot;no.&quot; You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.",32,Anita
5,17,No.,1,Barney

5,18,And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.,10,Robin
5,18,"Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.",17,Barney
5,18,"He was right. Your uncle Marshall is many things well, but for the pictures, it's terrible.",16,Ted (2030)
5,18,They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.,13,Marshall

5,18,You sure?,2,Barney
5,18,No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?,10,Robin

5,18,"These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.",11,Lily
5,18,This is what happened in Paris?,6,Robin
5,18,"In the first year of college, I studied in Paris, and I had not seen Marshall since 2 months.",19,Lily
5,18,2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months.,17,Marshall
5,18,"And Marshall came to me to spring break. And at the last minute, Ted decided to go with the girl he had just to get back, Karen.",27,Lily
5,18,I'm so excited you're here.,5,Ted
5,18,I'm so excited to go to Paris.,7,Karen

5,18,2 months! My balls were blue! Blue!,7,Marshall

5,18,You sure?,2,Barney
5,18,Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!,10,Robin

5,18,The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!,12,Lily
5,18,"I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.",61,Robin
5,18,Names that bitch!,3,Woman
5,18,Uh...,1,Man
5,18,You should listen to Robin.,5,Lily
5,18,Because Robin is your best friend.,6,Ted
5,18,Right.,1,Lily
5,18,Your best friend on Earth.,5,Ted
5,18,Absolutely.,1,Lily
5,18,Attention Lily. It's a trap.,5,Marshall
5,18,"Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.",15,Ted
5,18,"Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.",18,Lily
5,18,I'm starting to cry.,4,Robin
5,18,"It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this",20,Marshall
5,18,I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.,14,Ted
5,18,&quot;And nice and sweet and so nice! &quot;,8,Marshall Robin. Your part is this
5,18,Yes. We are a family. So why these parties can not they be us?,14,Lily

5,18,Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.,10,Ted
5,18,I did not say that!,5,Ted
5,18,It's as if you had done.,6,Lily
5,18,Here's Framboise.,2,Ted
5,18,You must order more food?,5,Marshall
5,18,No. Raspberry does not eat.,5,Ted
5,18,I am a vegetarian.,4,Raspberry
5,18,"Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you.",22,Lily
5,18,Meat is murder!  Murder!,4,Raspberry
5,18,I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?,11,Ted
5,18,It was called Raspberry!,4,All
5,18,"If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.",21,Ted

5,18,And that's it. I hope you will like.,8,Amanda
5,18,"&quot;Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori.&quot;",4,Lily
5,18,"Children, you remember the look &quot;you're dead to me&quot; Lily, she has this expression before exploding in a rage?Well, that was not it. But it was that of Marshall.",29,Ted (2030)
5,18,"&quot;42nd&quot;? Does the f*cking bomb appeared to have 42 years? Or worse, she has a mind to call Lori?!",19,Marshall
5,18,"No, Marshall, it does not matter.",6,Lily
5,18,If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!,12,Marshall
5,18,I'm sorry.,2,Amanda
5,18,Out!,1,Marshall
5,18,"Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.",15,Ted
5,18,"You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.",15,Marshall
5,18,What are you talking?,4,Ted
5,18,"You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.",38,Marshall
5,18,"I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?",17,Marshall
5,18,We broke... again! You sit with me a little while? Just sit down?,13,Natalie
5,18,You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.,14,Marshall
5,18,"And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.",17,Marshall
5,18,"I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.",15,Marshall
5,18,"I just thought we had something special, you know?",9,Woman
5,18,"Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling.",9,Marshall
5,18,I know if I'll get over it.,7,Woman
5,18,Shut up.,2,Marshall
5,18,"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.",23,Ted
5,18,They would be if Marshall was not on it.,9,Barney
5,18,Cheap Shot. Low blow.,4,Marshall
5,18,You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.,22,Ted
5,18,This is not true!,4,Lily
5,18,"Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.",24,Ted
5,18,"It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.",14,Marshall
5,18,"And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.",33,Ted
5,18,And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.,13,Robin
5,18,"Yeah, but you were beautiful.",5,Lily
5,18,And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.,10,Robin
5,18,"Actually, it was a good evening.",6,Marshall
5,18,It's true.,2,Lily
5,18,"Yeah, that was good.",4,Ted
5,18,Look at that one. This is the first picture of us three.,12,Lily
5,18,It's true.,2,Marshall
5,18,Do you remember what happened?,5,Ted
5,18,"Well, are you ready?",4,Man
5,18,"Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?",9,Ted
5,18,No! Why not sitcom of the 80s with two roommates who never agree?,13,Marshall
5,18,"Cool. Fine. One, two...",4,Man
5,18,"Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?",6,Lily
5,18,Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.,17,Marshall
5,18,And if you came to ask us?,7,Ted
5,18,Really?,1,Lily
5,18,Yeah.,1,Ted
5,18,"What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?",9,Marshall
5,18,And if you break it?,5,Ted
5,18,Come.,1,Marshall
5,18,I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.,22,Lily
5,18,I liked you.,3,Ted
5,18,We must bring back Amanda.,5,Lily
5,18,Really?,1,Ted
5,18,"You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.",19,Lily
5,18,"Thank you, Lil.",3,Ted
5,18,I think Lori's age made him very wise.,8,Robin
5,18,It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.,14,Barney
5,18,So your aunt Lily called Amanda.,6,Ted (2030)
5,18,"Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.",9,Lily
5,18,"Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.",17,Ted
5,18,It's a hole in your jacket?,6,Robin
5,18,What? Where?,2,Barney
5,18,"Now, Marshall!",2,Ted
5,18,sh1t!,1,Robin
5,18,Names that bitch.,3,Lily
5,18,Ann has...? Anna?,3,Ted
5,18,"No, it was my birthday.",5,Lily
5,18,Your brain is too predictable associations.,6,Marshall
5,18,"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.",9,Lily
5,18,Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...,20,Barney
5,18,Yes!,1,Robin

5,19,No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.,14,Ted (2030)
5,19,I love traveling.,3,Barney
5,19,Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?,10,Woman
5,19,"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.",23,Barney
5,19,You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.,23,Ted
5,19,"Ted, a blonde, it's easy.",5,Barney
5,19,"Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.",31,Barney

5,19,"Mayor McWouaf. It teaches the children clean, dressed dog. Finally, it is supposed to.",14,Robin

5,19,You have nabbed seven in a row?,7,Marshall
5,19,seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.,39,Ted
5,19,That's the thing with which you played the other day?,10,Robin
5,19,I was playing it. I was working.,7,Ted

5,19,"Pretty easy, huh? (And send the cork in the eye of Lily. Marshall and Lily sleeping when Marshall is a slap to Lily. Marshall before the fridge and opens the door when Lily arrives. They dance loose Lily and Marshall) Dispatch, baby. The party will begin.  You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!",54,Marshall
5,19,I have changed my mind.,5,Lily

5,19,The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,10,Ted
5,19,This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,19,Lily
5,19,Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,11,Barney
5,19,Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,12,Marshall

5,19,New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,10,Barney
5,19,Really? They caught him?,4,Robin
5,19,He is behind bars.,4,Ted
5,19,"So, where did they find?",5,Robin
5,19,"I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.",9,Lily
5,19,I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.,8,Robin
5,19,"You know how they caught him, huh?",7,Ted
5,19,They tracked.,2,Marshall
5,19,They tracked!,2,Ted
5,19,What's happening?,2,Robin
5,19,Okay. That's what happened.,4,Marshall

5,19,"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",11,Marshall
5,19,You're right. The banana was on the floor.,8,Barney
5,19,Was not... Was not banana banana.,6,Marshall
5,19,"Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",7,Barney
5,19,Do not shoot. There was no banana!,7,Marshall
5,19,"Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",14,Robin
5,19,"This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",38,Marshall
5,19,You've been mugged by a monkey!,6,Lily
5,19,It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,10,Ted
5,19,What? Him in your program? And my model?,8,Ted
5,19,No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,13,Robin
5,19,"First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",15,Ted
5,19,"So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",10,Robin
5,19,"Only if they are holding up well. Last year, I found one of her frolicking with GI Joe. This is not funny. What were you thinking? And if you were pregnant?",31,Men
5,19,And you invited back for a second interview.,8,Ted
5,19,"Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?",50,Robin
5,19,It would be nice to see you on TV.,9,Lily
5,19,Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself assaulted by a monkey?,19,Marshall

5,19,You're not supposed to be on a space mission?,9,Woman 2
5,19,You've just mugged?,3,Woman
5,19,"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",36,Barney
5,19,Me.,1,Woman 2
5,19,Me too.,2,Woman
5,19,And it was the best thing in my life 3.,10,Barney
5,19,"Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.",14,Ted
5,19,You're the lemon in your hair.,6,Marshall
5,19,"The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",20,Barney
5,19,"Marshall, you never will believe. I spoke to my producer monkey aggressor and he loves!",15,entering
5,19,Really? Cool.,2,Marshall
5,19,Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,10,Robin
5,19,"Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",25,Marshall
5,19,"The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",25,Robin
5,19,"Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",11,Marshall
5,19,It's a little embarrassing. So what?,6,Ted
5,19,That's not it. Guys... I'm not assaulted by a monkey.,10,Marshall
5,19,"So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?",8,Ted
5,19,Not at all.,3,Marshall
5,19,So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,17,Barney
5,19,"No, that's not it.",4,Marshall
5,19,So you got the monkey attacked?,6,Ted
5,19,"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gun.",12,Marshall
5,19,"You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?",17,Barney
5,19,That would be the right size.,6,Ted
5,19,"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.",17,Marshall
5,19,I can not believe.,4,Barney
5,19,What?,1,Marshall
5,19,You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,24,Barney
5,19,I would not?,3,Marshall
5,19,"If serious, this is too funny.",6,Barney
5,19,"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.",17,Marshall
5,19,"I, yes, but still.",4,Barney
5,19,But I can not lie on national TV.,8,Marshall
5,19,You know a long time. He told the truth?,9,Barney
5,19,"Ted, do not do that...",5,Marshall
5,19,I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,12,Ted
5,19,I still say that it happened.,6,Barney
5,19,"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",24,Ted
5,19,"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",17,Barney
5,19,"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",14,Ted
5,19,"False! They like to discover that they lied. &quot;Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth.&quot; Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!",30,Barney
5,19,You mean what you done to him.,7,Marshall
5,19,"No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",19,Barney
5,19,"Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.",10,Barney
5,19,"Yes, Neil?",2,Lisa
5,19,"It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.",11,Barney
5,19,"Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.",22,Lisa
5,19,"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!",59,Barney
5,19,This is the belt of Planar 3?,7,what happens
5,19,You know it.,3,Barney
5,19,Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a gun? I'm glad you assaulted by a monkey.,25,Lily
5,19,You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,13,Marshall
5,19,Yeah! I knew it.,4,Barney
5,19,Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,10,Ted
5,19,"Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",10,Barney
5,19,"Come on, Ted.",3,Marshall
5,19,"Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.",8,Ted
5,19,"Late the next night, we went on board the issue of Robin.",12,Ted (2030)
5,19,"Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?",12,Robin
5,19,"I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.",23,Ted
5,19,It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,16,Robin
5,19,"Dude, what do you do?",5,Barney
5,19,"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",38,Ted
5,19,Now I want a weapon.,5,Barney
5,19,The monkey is there.,4,Marshall
5,19,Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.,13,Robin
5,19,"Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.",13,Man
5,19,I bet he will love it.,6,Lily
5,19,"No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.",17,Man
5,19,The name of his companion is Milly?,7,Marshall
5,19,And then the interview began.,5,Ted (2030)
5,19,"In your own words, describe what happened.",7,Robin
5,19,"Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",19,Marshall
5,19,We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,8,Robin
5,19,"People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can shoot it?",21,Marshall
5,19,We come back.,3,Robin
5,19,It's good.,2,Mike
5,19,What are you doing?,4,Robin
5,19,I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a gun.,18,Marshall
5,19,You have not been attacked by a monkey?,8,Lily
5,19,"What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",9,Marshall
5,19,"Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",7,Robin
5,19,Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,11,Marshall
5,19,It's good. I buy a gun.,6,Lily
5,19,No. I got mugged.,4,Marshall
5,19,So Bobo goes.,3,Man
5,19,No! I have not been mugged!,6,Marshall
5,19,You know if it was attacked?,6,Barney
5,19,I have no idea.,4,Ted
5,19,"Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?",9,Man
5,19,Tell us just what happened.,5,Lily
5,19,"Yes, tell us the truth.",5,Robin
5,19,And that's when Marshall realized that there was one thing to say.,12,Ted (2030)
5,19,Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,11,Marshall
5,19,"And that was it. We never knew what really happened to the portfolio of Marshall. But we know that. Aunt Lily has never had a weapon, Robin's credibility remained intact, and Bobo and Milly lived together at the Central Park Zoo.",41,Ted (2030)
5,19,"sh1t. Okay, put a microphone.",5,Robin
5,19,Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,11,Ted
5,19,It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,25,Barney
5,19,"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",16,Ted
5,19,"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",18,Barney
5,19,I doubt it.,3,Ted
5,19,The children you will not believe what happened.,8,Ted (2030)
5,19,The monkey escaped!,3,Mike
5,19,It has one of my dolls!,6,Male 2
5,19,"Bobo, just there, Bobo.",4,Man
5,19,He climbs the building!,4,Mike
5,19,"Bobo, come here.",3,Man
5,19,I'll get it.,3,Mike
5,19,It's really happening?,3,Ted
5,19,"Of course, Ted.",3,Barney

5,20,"Yes, my mother was lapping. I married for the second time before I get married once. I was so happy for them.f*cking happy. While weddings can be magical. As far as I know, I'll end up dancing with my future wife in this marriage.",44,Ted (2030)

5,20,"Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?",19,Marshall
5,20,"Yeah, but where we're going to end?",7,Lily
5,20,"First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.",11,Ted
5,20,"Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",46,Ted
5,20,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Ted, come! Oh, my god!",8,All
5,20,We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.,16,Lily
5,20,I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.,16,Ted
5,20,"I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.",21,Ted
5,20,Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.,9,Ted

5,20,"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.",24,Ted
5,20,"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?",15,Barney
5,20,"Try not to laugh with you that, man.",8,Marshall
5,20,"So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",46,Ted
5,20,Whoa.,1,Robin
5,20,"Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",16,Lily
5,20,"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.",24,Ted
5,20,"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?",10,Barney
5,20,"Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.",19,Ted

5,20,"Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.",20,Lily
5,20,"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.",12,Robin
5,20,The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,7,Barney
5,20,"Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?",8,Marshall
5,20,Thank you.,2,Ted
5,20,"Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.",32,Marshall
5,20,"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",8,Robin
5,20,"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",14,Barney

5,20,It was not me!,4,Robin
5,20,What?,1,Lily
5,20,It's not me who cried during the song Clint.,9,Robin
5,20,Are you crying?,3,Robin
5,20,"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",13,Barney
5,20,Not as much as me.,5,Robin
5,20,I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,14,Barney
5,20,$ 500? No worries.,4,Robin
5,20,"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",20,Barney
5,20,"Wait, you're...",2,Barney
5,20,"Hi, I'm here for inspection.",5,Man going
5,20,"Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.",11,Ted
5,20,"Well I'm here for a while, but I think the bell does not work.",14,Man
5,20,Hmm.,1,Ted
5,20,"Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.",7,Man
5,20,"Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?",9,Barney
5,20,"Well, yeah.",2,Ted
5,20,Hey! Hey! Hey!,3,All
5,20,"Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",46,Marshall
5,20,I was...,2,Marshall
5,20,Marshall is dead! Marshall died!,5,Mother
5,20,"A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.",12,Marshall
5,20,"Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.",20,Ted
5,20,Hmm... sausage party?,3,Marshall
5,20,"Burgers, burgers will be made.",5,Ted
5,20,"Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",14,Lily
5,20,"Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really sh1t to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",48,Ted
5,20,"Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",26,Marshall
5,20,"Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",10,Robin
5,20,"Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.",26,Man
5,20,"You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",13,Lily
5,20,"You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",39,Ted
5,20,"I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",15,Marshall
5,20,"Not so fast.  was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.",67,Man
5,20,"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",16,Ted
5,20,"It was Robin! &quot;What! &quot;Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",31,Barney
5,20,"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",30,Robin
5,20,Of course.,2,Barney
5,20,"I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your pen1s is huge.",13,Robin
5,20,"Boy, you've almost had us still.",6,Lily
5,20,You're always a little too far.,6,Marshall
5,20,sh1t.,1,Barney
5,20,"Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.",13,Man
5,20,Really?,1,Ted
5,20,"Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.",111,Man
5,20,And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,11,Ted
5,20,I'll see at the top if all goes well.,9,Man
5,20,He said he had found a tramp?,7,Marshall
5,20,"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",59,Ted
5,20,I see a complaint.,4,Barney
5,20,Found termites.,2,Man
5,20,"Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has killed some cockroaches at the time of impact.",17,Robin
5,20,"Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",19,Lily
5,20,"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",37,Ted
5,20,Thank you. My God.,4,Barney
5,20,Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.,25,Ted
5,20,"OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.",12,Barney
5,20,What do you mean?,4,Ted
5,20,"Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.",13,Barney
5,20,"Please, stop.",2,Ted
5,20,"Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.",11,Barney
5,20,What are you talking about?,5,Ted
5,20,I wanted to be your father!,6,Barney
5,20,What does that mean?,4,Ted
5,20,"Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.",37,Barney
5,20,And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.,13,Barney
5,20,Here we go.,3,Virginia
5,20,It is a good time. Not much traffic...,8,Barney
5,20,"Oh, I love this song.",5,Virginia
5,20,Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...,13,Barney
5,20,Your pen1s is huge.,4,Virginia
5,20,Again?! One too many!,4,Marshall

5,20,I can... I can give you some ideas I have?,10,Ted
5,20,Yeah.,1,Marshall

5,21,No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.,19,Robin
5,21,Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?,12,Ted
5,21,"All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.",23,Barney

5,21,You... and Robin...,3,Barney

5,21,I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.,10,Barney
5,21,You were emptied from the top and bottom.,8,Ted
5,21,Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.,10,Barney
5,21,"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.",12,Ted
5,21,"You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.",18,Barney
5,21,That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.,7,Ted
5,21,For my biographer?,3,Barney
5,21,"Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you.

5,21,"So that night, with Barney, we sat down to talk calmly and reasonably to the most deserving Robin.",18,Ted (2030)

5,21,We all talk!,3,Ted
5,21,I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.,8,Lily

5,21,You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.,17,Lily
5,21,"To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.",31,Marshall

5,21,Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.,14,Ted
5,21,You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...,15,Barney
5,21,It's BarnExclussif.,2,Barney

5,21,It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?,6,Ted
5,21,"No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.",19,Robin
5,21,"Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem.",8,Barney
5,21,What's the matter?,3,Robin
5,21,There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.,9,Ted
5,21,We almost lose control.,4,Ted
5,21,It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.,9,Barney

5,21,What?,1,Lily
5,21,"I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so...",15,Marshall
5,21,You throw me like that?,5,Lily
5,21,You knew before you start.  Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try.,11,Marshall
5,21,"The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.",4,Robin
5,21,Dad?,1,Barney
5,21,"We get up, fuckers. You remember last night?",8,Robin
5,21,"Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing...",5,Barney
5,21,"I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.",27,Ted
5,21,"Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.",52,Robin
5,21,So what's going on with Robin?,6,Barney
5,21,"You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of sh1t.",24,Ted
5,21,"I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past.",29,Barney
5,21,Let me see!,3,Ted
5,21,Give me that.,3,Barney
5,21,"Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.",32,Ted

5,23,"This is where I realized that everyone has baggage, including me.",11,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,23,Nothing.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another.,17,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,23,Why? So why should it?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,Because it is past the fifth most profitable films.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,23,I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,He looks like zero.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>

5,23,That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,23,I was determined to make this film as far from me as possible. Unfortunately...,14,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,23,It was not great the bride?,6,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,I too loved it!,4,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,23,We'll see tomorrow.,3,<strong>Man</strong>
5,23,It may come? Want to see it again?,8,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,"Yeah, that was good.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,"&quot;Good&quot;? Rather perfect! The only thing, and for me it is a very small defect, compared to other films, is that I understand why Stella wants to marry a guy like Jed Mosley. Just the name of this guy",39,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,"Royce, you're out with Jed Mosley, too.",7,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,23,"Who has not? It is a sacred number. A butterfly tattoo, how to pronounce this encyclopedia.",16,<strong>Royce</strong>

5,23,"I was so happy that this loser is done let go before the altar. You know why? Because he saw it coming. And the best part is that he will live a long, sad life, knowing he has lost his only chance of happiness. And when he gets beaten up by the goat?",53,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,Too funny!,2,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,23,Bluntly!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,What a loser!,3,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,"Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf Hitler, a new king has arrived!",51,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,"Ted, you're okay?",3,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.,26,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,"It was really bad, you should apologize.",7,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,Bluntly not Carr√©ment doll... not...,5,<strong>Ted stood up</strong>
5,23,"You said &quot;not altogether, doll?&quot;",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,23,You really used the phrase Jed Mosley?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,23,I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,I wanted to see Avatar.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,23,It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,"Good luck. This film is international, it's great.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,23,Maybe North Korea?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>

5,23,"Sorry, Ted, you're screwed.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,23,"No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, &quot;Hi, stranger. Can I help you? &quot;And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted? Inside you, you're still that guy.",78,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,23,I still am.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,You wanna go get that girl.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,23,I want to go get that girl.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,For it is the love of your life.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,23,"Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,Because she's nice.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,23,"It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,The wedding is in 15 minutes. I'll never make it.,10,<strong>Tony</strong>

5,23,I must say something.,4,<strong>Tony</strong>
5,23,"I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,What do you mean?,4,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,You can not talk to me like that!,8,<strong>Jed</strong>
5,23,"I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,"To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,23,What...,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,I wanted... People want to know.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,23,They are burgundy in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,All I wanted was some pancakes this week.,8,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,"Come on, darling, kiss him.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>

5,23,"Bluntly, doll.",2,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,23,"That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,Let me help you.,4,<strong>Royce</strong>
5,23,"And like that, kids, my luggage no longer seemed so heavy. Everyone has his baggage, it's part of life. But like everything else, it's easier when someone helps us.",29,<strong>Ted (2030)</strong>
5,23,It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,23,"It's not that important. Me too, I was let go before the altar. Three times. The last time, because I lost all our money at poker. That's why I live with my brother.",33,<strong>Royce</strong>

5,24,I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,I know what's bothering you.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>

5,24,You kiss?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,24,Why are you in our room? (Robin's turn to...) Why are you in our room?  Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?,22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,It works!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,24,Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has &quot;forgotten&quot; to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,24,"What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,"By omission, because this idea of &quot;let the world decide&quot; is crazy.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,"Baby, you...",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,We must control our...,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>

5,24,"I know. It's weird, huh?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.,24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?,17,<strong>Robin</strong>

5,24,how Kristof?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,Kristof... Sosie.,2,<strong>Sosia</strong>
5,24,Really? Your last name is &quot;Sosie&quot;?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,"It's my name, man.",4,<strong>Lookalike</strong>
5,24,Wait. Trying to understand.,4,<strong>Don</strong>
5,24,I'm going.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,24,Wait. Put yourself in my place. You can imagine what it is to be offered a dream job?,18,<strong>Don</strong>
5,24,"I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,24,"Barney, why are you doing this?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
5,24,Who is Barney? Calm down the U.S.!,7,<strong>Sosia</strong>
5,24,Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,I'd be interested to read what he has to say in his blog.,13,<strong>Sosie</strong>
5,24,"But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.",35,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,Babies... this can be cute.,5,<strong>Sosia</strong>
5,24,"And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
5,24,Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.,11,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,24,Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
5,24,And I'm like you clown.,5,<strong>Woman</strong>
5,24,Say yes to that.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,24,Yes.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,24,I can re-move? (Ted takes her in his arms. They sit on the couch) Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?,22,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,24,"Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.",80,<strong>Ted</strong>
5,24,Seems like I become more and more stupid.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
5,24,"Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us.

6,1,Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,1,That girl she's talking to? I dated her.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,1,"Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,1,"So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,1,"Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,1,"Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of... But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle?",38,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,1,I got to see her ankles.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,1,"You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...",11,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,1,Jealous?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,1,"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,1,"I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,1,"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",47,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,1,I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,1,We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,"So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, &quot;I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.&quot;",27,Marshall
6,1,Out for three months?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,19,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,1,"You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,"Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,Ted?,1,<strong>Cindy</strong>

6,1,"Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,1,Why not?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,1,Thanks.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,1,I braced myself for what was next,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,1,"Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or...",61,<strong>Cindy</strong>
6,1,"Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,1,"No, it wouldn't.",3,<strong>Cindy</strong>
6,1,"It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,1,"What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,Here's the thing.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,1,"Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go?",15,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,1,"Dad, this is...",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,1,Did it feel like a boy? You can tell.,9,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,1,"He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,"You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",34,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,"Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,23,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,1,"Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",45,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,1,"Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it.

6,1,"You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,1,No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,1,"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future.

6,2,"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Yeah, that's what your mom said.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,How dare you!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"No, she actually said that.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there.",15,<strong>Lauretta</strong>
6,2,"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?",7,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,James!,1,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,2,Bro!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,How you doing?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Hey!,1,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Oh, my goodness!",3,<strong>Lauretta</strong>
6,2,Mama.,1,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.,11,<strong>Lauretta</strong>
6,2,Mom. Stop.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?",16,<strong>Lauretta</strong>
6,2,"Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?",25,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Oh, you know, how funny you are...",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Guilty.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Handsome.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"Who, me?",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Incredible lover.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Really?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, &quot;He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours...&quot; Blah, blah, blah. &quot;Orgasms so intense that you just black out.&quot; All that stuff.",45,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.,12,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,That sounds plausible.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.",39,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"&quot;Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10",60,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,Thank you.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,"Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",12,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Oh, I don't know... That guy.",6,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,"Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.",53,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was &quot;sick&quot; and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4&quot; in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,I always find that reassuring.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"You will meet her, buddy.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,You think so?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Yeah!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,"Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",53,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,I'm not lying to our kids.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",21,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,No idea. Why?,3,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Mom addressed this and never sent it.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,What's in it?,3,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... &quot;Your son.&quot;",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",9,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,"Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?",4,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?,8,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote &quot;your son&quot; on the back.,21,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Oh, no, that... It says &quot;Yourson.&quot; For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?",65,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,"If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?",18,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!",34,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,Can you believe her?,4,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,How?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"I sent her another email. &quot;Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.&quot;",41,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"&quot;Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.&quot;",31,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"See, now you went too far in the other...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,&quot;I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.&quot;,29,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Stop!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",23,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.",34,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,Not now.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",12,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.,14,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,"Oh, what's done is done.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,&quot;Ted Mosby is solid as a rock.&quot; No. &quot;Dependable.&quot; No. &quot;Rugged.&quot; No.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? &quot;Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control.&quot; Oh, damn.",34,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,That last bump just made me hit send.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"Oh, no.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. &quot;Everyone&quot;?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,&quot;Really rich&quot;?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,You ready for this?,4,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,I thought you said that he... Stop.,7,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",62,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,Come here.,2,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Can I help you?,4,<strong>Sam Gibbs</strong>
6,2,Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs.,4,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,Yes.,1,<strong>Sam Gibbs</strong>
6,2,"I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s.",17,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Loretta! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Loretta.",8,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,My mother meant to send you this.,7,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,You're my son.,3,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,"God, this must be so hard for Barney.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",41,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.",23,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,"Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.",64,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,"Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,He's also quite the detective.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"Or, he could just let him have this one.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Are you kidding?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,2,"Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",44,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,2,"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",41,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common.",15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,2,Come on. You know this. Come on.,7,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,There you go. Come on.,5,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,Weird day.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,Weird day.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,27,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,Maybe a little.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,You said she was a ten.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,I did not specify on what scale.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,You said she looked like a movie star.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,2,"She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,2,"Dad, look how fast I can run!",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son.",12,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,I have a grandson?,4,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,His name's Eli.,3,<strong>James</strong>
6,2,He's beautiful.,2,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,2,"Dad, you're not looking!",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart.",28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,2,Barney? I need to talk to you.,7,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.",54,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,Are you sure?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.",17,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,"And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,2,"I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible.",12,<strong>Basketball coatch</strong>
6,2,"What'd Coach say, Ma?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.,29,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,Why didn't anyone come?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. &quot;Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize &quot;for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.&quot;",40,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,Barney.,1,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,But it's your father.,4,<strong>Loretta</strong>
6,2,I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,2,"Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom.",38,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,2,Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?,15,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,3,"Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is &quot;unfinished.&quot; Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...",57,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"But first, let's back up a few days.",8,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,3,"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,I don't know. Got a burger coming.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Hi. Barney Stinson.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,Thank you for your time.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"So, get this",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"And now, the 11",4,TV Speaker
6,3,"Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,That's great. Good for you.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Yeah, thank you.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Where's the poop, Robin?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,Excuse me?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?",34,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,I don't know what you're talking about.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Where's the poop, Robin?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,There's no poop.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,Where's the poop?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Hey, Don, here's some breaking news",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.",41,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,That's great.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,Thank you.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing.",40,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,Prove it. Delete contact.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,There. Deleted.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Back already. How was flying solo? And by &quot;solo,&quot; I mean so low that you got shot down.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,Golden rule,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor.",11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,3,"What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.",43,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,It's my building.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.",41,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,3,"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.",31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,No? Are you kidding me?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",65,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",40,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,Of course not.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,All right.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night...,14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,3,"I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",38,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,I need another drink.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"Marshall, you want anything?",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"No, I'm fine.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Wait, you turned down the job? When?",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,This morning.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Chrissy, I love your glasses.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Really?,1,<strong>Chrissy</strong>
6,3,They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,But Barney hasn't done...,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"Hey, Lily!",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Don't &quot;Hey, Lily&quot; me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Oh, no, not this again.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Where's the poop, Robin?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Okay, I left Don another message.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,&quot;This just in&quot; is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,But that's impossible. You deleted his number.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",33,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"My &quot;plezh.&quot; If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,Super Kicks Karate.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"No, not that one. That's my dojo.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,You have a dojo?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,I took an introductory karate class.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"What's the matter, lady? You scared?",6,<strong>Boy</strong>
6,3,Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,I hated kindergarten. All three times.,6,<strong>Boy</strong>
6,3,But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,How long ago did you take that class?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, &quot;Wassuuuuuuup!&quot;",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,I might.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",36,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,No! Barney's been &quot;putting the moves&quot; on Ted.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",77,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,He did.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,And the intense eye contact thing?,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Okay. Yep.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,That is so true.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,22,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"So at any point in this did you say, &quot;Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job&quot;?",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,You're loving this.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,You are. You're loving the attention.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,Robin never deleted Don's number.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,Edwin.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",34,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Probably not, baby.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,Okay. Your turn.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"Barney, I gotta tell you something.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,22,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, &quot;pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more.&quot; It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, &quot;Oh, God, I never should have said no.&quot;",49,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Okay, I'll do it!",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"What? Ted, it's too late.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,25,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"Okay, it's a move.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,Dude!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,You guys lied to me?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,236.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",34,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,"No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",103,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Hey, guys.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Where's the poop, Robin?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,I think that's just called a dog.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,3,"Where's the poop, Robin?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,Fine. I called Don again.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",79,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,I thought you deleted his number.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,3,"I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",66,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,3,"Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",86,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,Why aren't you in class?,5,<strong>Rachel</strong>
6,3,"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,3,Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,3,And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. And even though it didn't happen right away...,36,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,3,"And now, the 11",4,<strong>TV Speaker</strong>

6,4,That's adorable. You're from Canada.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,4,I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.,22,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,4,"Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,"Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say &quot;carrots and peas&quot;. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,"What, you really had something to talk about?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,"Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.",61,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,"Robin, I had no idea.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,"No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,Stopping the car.,3,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
6,4,"No, don't stop the car.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,Not stopping the car.,4,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
6,4,"Seriously, stop the car.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,Seriously stopping the car.,4,<strong>Ranjit</strong>

6,4,* Our hero's strength was fading fast just as the light turned... green. He then thought back to all the times he'd lost to a machine. The cable box is fearsome but the stapler's mighty sting... The cable box's bite again... Getting too tired to sing. *,47,<strong>Folk singer</strong>

6,4,"Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization. If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus...It's you<em>. </em> The good news is, I was halfway there, and nothing could stop me.",33,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,4,Whoa! This is crazy.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,I can't believe it.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,"Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.",21,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,4,Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,"And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.",44,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,4,"And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,He did smell incredible.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,4,Sweetie? Are you okay?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over.,19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,"You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.",46,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,What did he say?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,"No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,Hey! Lily.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,"Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker<em>. </em> Damn it. <em></em> Hey, it's Lily. Help me.",41,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,4,Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,4,"My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,"Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,4,"Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,64. But whatever.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,4,"And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,"Sounds like you guys need to clear everything, subtract the negativity, and add some perspective.",15,<strong>Man</strong>

6,4,There it is.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,4,Here's how it happened.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,4,"Okay, he's in. Go. Go. Gun it.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,Ted is in the way.,5,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
6,4,Run him over.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,Running him over.,3,<strong>Ranjit</strong>
6,4,"No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.,22,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,"Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,Why did I get so crazy about this?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,"Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.",38,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,"Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,It's only been two months.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,We are crazy.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,We're totally crazy.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?,20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,We gotta go back to Paris.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,And take ballroom dancing.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,"And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,"Oh, a cradle list.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,4,"I'm... So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race.",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,4,It isn't a race.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,4,No!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,4,"So I said, &quot;the cab, of course&quot;",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,I know what you did back there.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,4,"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.",17,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,4,"Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,4,I always get those two confused.,6,<strong>Max</strong>
6,4,"Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term... A real New Yorker.",46,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,5,"Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,5,I can't design the building.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Oh, yeah.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,5,"Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school... with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off.",24,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,5,Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,5,"Oh, the small pen1s thing?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him &quot;Max.&quot;,42,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,5,Just don't!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,You're kidding me.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,5,Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Everything.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,"So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,5,"Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. &quot;Hey, look how big my cell phone is!&quot; You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.",45,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,5,How can you speak of such things?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, &quot;Boobs?&quot; Not the complete sentence, &quot;Does she have big boobs?&quot; Which also would not be great. Just",35,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,I do not do that.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,My friend Lori from work...,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small pen1s... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,Impossible. Max's pen1s is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,27,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,Duh. Of course there's a girl.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,5,What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Boobs?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,5,"Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.,14,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,"Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...",11,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Whose dream?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,We wound up talking for hours.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.,17,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.",16,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.,23,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,"Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tranny before, but it's still sweet.",19,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,"Hey, Ted, can I ask you something",7,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,Anything.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian&quot; We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?,25,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,5,And you said...?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,Where do I sign?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"And what did this &quot;Zoey&quot; say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"So what do you do, Ted?",6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,5,I'm a veterinarian.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,What? I panicked!,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,I don't do that.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (<em>Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard)</em> Look, she's really hot, okay?",37,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,23,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Asian girls love them some Jews.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,And you're welcome.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",40,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"No. Technically, they were eggs.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,Did you just say &quot;eggs&quot;?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,5,"Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"Bro, it's... pretty small.",4,<strong>Max</strong>
6,5,"Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? &quot;The motion of the ocean.&quot; That whole thing.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,5,I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,5,As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity...,15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,5,...</strong>the strangest thing happened.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030

6,5,Wasn't expecting bunnies.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,5,Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge.",19,<strong>Max</strong>

6,5,"Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,5,Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about s*x?,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,"Yes, we do, but you know what we say? &quot;I hit that.&quot;&quot;I got some.&quot;&quot;I tapped it.&quot; &quot;I squeezed those.&quot; Discreet and efficient.",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,Not to mention classy.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,5,"Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our s*x life, I'd probably kill myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,5,Are you sure?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,5,How the hell could you do that?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,28,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,"The billboard, Barney.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,5,Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,5,You named the rabbit?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,5,So you're back in?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,5,"Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,5,"Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.",12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,5,"Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",51,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together... the girl, the building, everything, until...",19,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,5,Are you married?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?",11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,5,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Yeah, it was about the girl.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,"Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,5,"This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",21,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,5,Snakes?,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,5,I don't recall saying snakes.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,5,But here's the crazier part.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,5,That sounds real.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,5,"And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again.",39,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,5,"Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!",26,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,5,"Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again.",8,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,6,"That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,6,"Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say &quot;Who's your daddy?&quot; to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.",68,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,6,"Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?",32,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,6,You did it? How?,4,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,6,"Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,6,"Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some?",9,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,6,No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,6,"Challenge completed! <em></em> Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,6,I got this.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,6,We're idiots.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,6,"Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,6,Whoa.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,6,Ten-pound? Eight-pound?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,6,"I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my v*g1n* can't cash.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,6,I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,7,I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that?,13,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,They never arrived at the downtown office.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is &quot;send them downtown&quot; not an expression for shredding a document?",22,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,You shredded them?!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.",26,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.",11,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,I'll say this,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,"Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...",37,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,7,Fine. It's Bill Pepper.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,7,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,What's The Arcadian?,3,<strong>Student</strong>
6,7,"Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down.",14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,7,"What?! No, Professor Mosby loves old buildings. He wouldn't do that. Right, Ted?",13,<strong>Student</strong>
6,7,Getting back to Greek Revival...,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,I lost them.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley...",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,Johnny? Johnny!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?,37,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,We're familiar with it.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,Shuts them right up.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"Oh, baby, what's wrong?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,Something bad happened.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Randy, hey, have you seen the...",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on... Voil&amp;agrave;!",14,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,That's the Hermanson contract?,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No... <em></em> Anyway, what's your thing?",18,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,I need the Filbert contract!,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.",15,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,You slept with Randy!,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,What?!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,"Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, &quot;Boats! Boats!

Randy has a unique condition.",50,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,"Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.",14,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,That's...exactly what happened.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,"Randy, hey, what's going on?",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,I just wanted to say no hard feelings.,8,<strong>Randy</strong>

6,7,No!!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"It's okay, baby.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,It wasn't okay. So the next morning...,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,7,"Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.,12,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,7,"No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say &quot;GNB Cares,&quot; and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",55,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.",9,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,7,Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.,14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...",11,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,7,"No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.",44,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,7,"Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was &quot;Boo freakin' hoo&quot;?",19,<strong>Student</strong>
6,7,Boo... freakin'...,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.,12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,7,"The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?,11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,7,No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell.",12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,7,And did it work?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",43,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"Hey, guys.",2,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy murdered him.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?,12,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"I'm trying to eat here, buddy.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.",12,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,You didn't sleep with her?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.",12,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,So why are you smiling?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,I'll tell you why.,4,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,This just isn't working out.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life.",56,thinking</strong>

6,7,"I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!,14,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,I-I can't. I need my severance check.,7,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.,24,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.",7,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Green tie?  Nice choice.",48,</strong> <em>entering</em> <em>the room</em>
6,7,Thanks. It brings out my eyes.,6,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.,6,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,7,"Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.",30,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Oh, we'll see about that.",5,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. &quot;We care about making dreams come true,&quot; in three, two...",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,No!,1,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,What are you doing?,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.",19,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,And there's more.,3,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,"I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,Now am I fired?,4,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,"Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,7,Hello.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,I like my teachers.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.",35,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,Was there more to that story?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,A little bit.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Lily, you're a psychopath.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"A little bit. Oh, a panda!",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try.,13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,7,"Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?",12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,7,Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an &quot;F.&quot;,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,You said that?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought &quot;F&quot; had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,Yeah.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Hey, guys.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,"Robin, who'd you sleep with?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,"Where's the poop, Robin?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,7,"Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.",30,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,What... Why didn't you tell us?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"Bladder trouble; it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.",11,<strong>Announcer</strong>
6,7,I'm going to the bathroom right now.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.,7,<strong>Announcer</strong>
6,7,Say... &quot;Ah...&quot;,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,Wow! I can't wait to see it.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,7,"Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,7,It ran for seven years.,5,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,7,You think working here is my dream?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.",18,<strong>Randy</strong>
6,7,Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,7,"Kids, the next morning, my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because...",43,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,8,"Kids, one morning in 2010, I opened the newspaper only to discover an op-ed written by Zoey Pierson. You remember Zoey.",21,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,8,Key Ted Mosby's car.,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"In those four column inches, she railed against me and my company, GNB, for wanting to tear down a beautiful old building",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,8,She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a &quot;fat cat.&quot; Me and my &quot;fat-cat friends.&quot; We're not fat cats.,28,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Impeccable, old bean. To industry!",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Ah, bully!",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us.",40,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,8,"Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Nice monkey suit, Russell.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Come on, guys.",3,<strong>Russel</strong>
6,8,"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.,20,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.",27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Ooh.,1,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,8,"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, &quot;Don't touch anything&quot;. To a kid. That's like someone telling us &quot;Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.&quot;",35,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,Ooh.,1,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,8,Not bad.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,8,"Well, ahoy.",2,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,Ahoy.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Ahoy, The Captain.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.,9,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,8,"Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything.",9,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Thank you, The Captain.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Challenge accepted.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,Wow. &quot;The future of Goliath National Bank&quot;?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.",22,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,I think I'm going to say yes.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Ah, that's the stuff.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,Impressive. Try this on for size.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,You want to dance? Let's dance.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,I live for the dance.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,Get... your other hand... off my ass.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"Sorry, sorry.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"What do you mean, you're going to say yes?",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,I-I want to keep working at GNB.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,But I thought that you...,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,8,"Zoey? Well, well, well.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,You have got to be kidding me.,7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?",23,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Darling, there you are.",4,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Ted, this is my husband.",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Yeah, old stuff's great.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,You're right.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Yeah, I do.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.,11,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,This is Ted.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat.",16,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.",5,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,She!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?,15,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Yes. The sea is all like, &quot;Ted, come hang out.&quot;",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off.,14,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.,14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,You're going down.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Wieners.,1,<em>whispering</em>
6,8,"That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Wieners and gonads.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Boogers.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell &quot;women&quot; with a &quot;Y&quot; anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.",36,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,So how long have you felt this way?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Hershey squirts.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.,12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,Good luck killing James Bond. <em></em> Are we allowed in here?,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,What do you want from me?,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,My life isn't perfect.,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,It did.,2,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,8,"You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Affirmatootly.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,And become an environmental lawyer?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Yepskerdoodles.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Posititochadochmecochepopocha.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Lawyered.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Okay, that's also a made-up word.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Niled it.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,Excuse me.,2,<strong>Museum guard</strong>
6,8,Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.,10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.,15,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.",79,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.",46,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Ted, that was... really easy.",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.,7,<strong>Ted's voice (on a recording)</strong>
6,8,This should be useful.,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes.",10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,8,You tricked me.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.",26,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it...",53,<strong>Guard</strong>
6,8,I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.",7,<strong>Guard</strong>
6,8,"Oh, yeah, that story is legend...  Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"No. But I could, uh, check the files.",8,<strong>Guard</strong>
6,8,Thank you.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from <em>Guys and Dolls</em>.",18,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche.",10,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,8,So I hear my wife got you pretty good.,9,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,She caught me on tape trashing GNB.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. &quot;But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend.&quot; &quot;I said no such thing.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings.",55,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,Really? You'd do that to your own wife?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem.",39,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking.",20,<strong>George</strong>
6,8,"Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room.",30,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,8,"July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson.",40,<strong>Guard</strong>
6,8,"Who's the master, Leroy?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker.",13,<strong>Guard</strong>
6,8,"Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.,15,<strong>Guard</strong>
6,8,Jerry's my uncle.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a hit of this sandwich?",14,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,I want you.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Awesome. Let me just put a sock on the doorknob.,10,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,"No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,What? How have I changed? Did I cheat on you?,10,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,No.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Did I stop writing poems for you?,7,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Yes, but I'm okay with that.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you?",13,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,You said that any longer would be too much.,9,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,"It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.",41,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction.",18,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,They did?,2,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,"Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good?,11,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,Sure.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts.",21,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,Hey.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,Hi.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,"Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?",46,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,8,We'll make it work.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,8,There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man.,17,<strong>College Marshall</strong>
6,8,So when was the last time you saw him?,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,Moms.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"Barney, do you want...?",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,8,"I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,8,"I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?,17,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Oh, I thought we were...",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,Fine. I erased the tape.,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square.,12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,Thanks.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.,14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,8,"Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.",14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,8,"Bring it on, Princess.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,9,Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.",26,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Look at this crib.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,9,Thank you.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,I know. Isn't it?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,Why are you wearing that?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Why does Barney do anything ever?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The &quot;everyday boutonniere&quot; by Stinson.",36,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.",32,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,9,"Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,That sounds ridiculous.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to.,12,<strong>Robin Sparkles</strong>
6,9,"Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh?",11,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,"Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life.",16,<strong>Robin Sparkles</strong>
6,9,"Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.",10,<strong>Robot</strong>
6,9,Brace for turbulence!,3,<strong>Robin Sparkles</strong>
6,9,"Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,You can't do that on television.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,Exactly.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,No. You can't do that on television!,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",30,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",40,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?",31,<strong>Man</strong>
6,9,Oh. 30.,2,<strong>Robin Sparkles</strong>
6,9,Yes! Oh! Seven times four?,5,<strong>Man</strong>
6,9,28!,1,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,Keep going! Eight times nine?,5,<strong>Man</strong>
6,9,72!,1,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?,8,<strong>Man</strong>
6,9,"I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",38,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,But BFFs are forever.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,I'm still friends with Punchy.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",43,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Schmosby!,1,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Punchy!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",6,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Definitely.,1,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,We are just two peas.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,18,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",36,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Four years, three months.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Of course. Robin hates kids.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, &quot;To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,Robin's gonna dump me!,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, sweetheart.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,When a second uterus plumped becomes...,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Dude. Feel the room.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,No.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,We've been waiting all day!,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Just watch it without me.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Two dudes on the couch together watching p0rn? That's kind of weird.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Okay, it's not p0rn, it's a kids' show.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,We...,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,I'm serious.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Hey Jessica, how's your beaver?",5,<strong>Robin Sparkles</strong>
6,9,Great. How's your beaver?,4,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,Busy as ever!,3,<strong>Robin Sparkles</strong>
6,9,Our characters had pet beavers.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Sure.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,It's a noble creature.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?",85,<strong>Man</strong>
6,9,"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,No arguments here.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,'Sup Shmosby!,2,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Punchy, what are you doing here?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?",13,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.",17,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?",41,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!",14,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,21,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Don't care.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Get a hotel.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Robin... LeBron.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Okay, one night. Got to go.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Where are you going? We just got here.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, a Korean massage.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,By yourself?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,I don't.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Lily, how old am I?",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,384 months.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,Busted!,1,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies.,12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,9,"Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Crib...,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,What's the matter? You look rattled.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,What?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",26,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,What's that supposed to mean?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",40,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",31,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,Great.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,Great.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you &quot;accidentally&quot; shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,No!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,Okay.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,Times Square's the bomb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.,14,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?,10,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Times Square's the bomb!,4,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.,14,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, &quot;You are the weakest link. Goodbye.&quot; Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",62,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Okay, yeah. I know.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",56,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.",14,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,That's your scrotum.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.",19,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Yeah, he's gotta go.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,How did you find Glitter?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",39,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.",13,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,"Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now?",11,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin.,8,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,"Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her.",14,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,What? Why?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to kill herself.",55,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,Charge!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby?,9,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,"Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually...(<em>Marshall is playing the piano)</em> Hey. Go ahead.",49,<strong>Jessica Glitter</strong>
6,9,"Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?",12,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Punchy, it's time to go back.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Back to Times Square?!,4,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.",35,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,You worry about me?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Yeah. The other day, when you called...",7,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Schmosby!,1,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Punchy!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",6,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Definitely.,1,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Sweetie, who was that?",4,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,9,It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.,10,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?,10,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,9,"Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.",36,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.",23,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,9,You think that would work?,5,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Worked on me.,3,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,9,"Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.",9,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.",23,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,Of course I will.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,"Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...",9,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,9,"That night, Lily went to the one place she knew she could find Robin-- New York's premiere Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut.",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,9,"Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,31,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,9,"Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,I'm so happy you guys made up.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,9,"Me, too.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,9,Where do I know this song from?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,9,"Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,9,"* Hey, beaver, come on; When you feel alone; Just pick up that phone; And I'll be there to share my... *",22,</strong> <em>singing</em>

6,10,"What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval.

6,10,"How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,I'm not The Blitz!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Finish the story, Red.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.",20,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,Can I... help you?,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Well, yeah.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online.,10,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,<em></em> That was you?!,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,Yeah.,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Oh! Thanks!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,"The Gentleman! (whooping, applause)",4,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,10,"And then, the craziest thing happened.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,I missed a skateboarding dog?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,It wasn't?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare?",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger.,15,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Best idea ever!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers.,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"4, 8... 15, 16, 23, 42!",6,<strong>Blitz</strong>
6,10,And... send!,2,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Wait. Blitz was there, too?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,The Gentleman!,2,<strong>Blitz</strong>
6,10,The Gentleman!,2,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,10,"Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; can wait a night.",20,<strong>Blitz</strong>
6,10,"It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,I'm not The Blitz!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,Blitz...,1,<strong>Mysterious voice</strong>
6,10,"I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years",15,<strong>Blitz</strong>
6,10,"Well, not anymore, Blitz.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz.",16,<strong>Blitz</strong>
6,10,"What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!",48,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,I tried.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Ren√©e Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,That's Kate Hudson!,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? <em></em> Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.",47,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,The oven.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,"Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out...,10,<em>chanting</em>
6,10,Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome!,11,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"But if it helps, I reached 4G.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,This is awesome! I'm part of this!,7,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explosion at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,This is awesome!,3,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,It's not awesome!,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger.",17,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.",25,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Could we bring Ted?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,No. Absolutely not.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Come on. Give her a chance.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?",18,<strong>Babaka</strong>
6,10,No. I c... Because... Step on it.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,You missed it.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!",16,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang &quot;Twist and Shout!&quot;,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,But he's The Blitz.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.,16,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Blitz...,1,<strong>Mysterious voice</strong>
6,10,"Oh, God, no!",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,Chicka-chicka!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Zoey.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Best friend alert!,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, God, that is disgusting!",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,It's a boom-a-wang.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,Nice.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,Thank you.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"No, I meant the wang.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,"Barney, could you get me some more ice?",8,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.,20,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Okay, I got to test this.",6,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,What happened?,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,You missed it!,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.,30,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.",6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Facial!,1,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,I'm coming with you.,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,No... I baste alone.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.",8,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Word play. Loving it.,4,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.,16,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Who canceled? Your coven?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Coven. Group of witches.,4,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.,12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Oh! Serve returned.,3,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",13,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling.",12,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Ted, give her a chance.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,Enemies can't become friends.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Yes, they can. Right, guys?",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Well, let's get an outside opinion.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,Who are we gonna...,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,&quot;Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.&quot;,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...",31,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,"Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,What? No. Shut up. I hate him.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,"Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. &quot;Yes, enemies can become friends. &quot;Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'&quot;",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?",7,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha!  Burn on her.",19,<em>laughing</em>
6,10,"Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.",7,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!,22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,What does that have to do with anything?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,10,Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, my God!",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Did you do that on purpose?,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,What? No. It was an accident.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.",6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Oh, great. Real mature.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Yeah, well, you started it.",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh, get out. All of you, out!",7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,But it's Thanksgiving.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,And I'm a part of it.,6,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,Out!,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Wait... Where's Barney?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear.,15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,10,Where to?,2,<strong>Driver</strong>
6,10,I guess we're going home.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Yeah. I don't know where that is.,7,<strong>Driver</strong>
6,10,"Lily, where'd you get that?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? &quot;Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey.&quot; I wonder who Hannah is.",36,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,10,"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",38,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"Get out! All of you, out!",6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,We have to go back to Zoey's.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.",7,<strong>Driver</strong>
6,10,"Oh, God. What are you doing here?",7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Barney let us in.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.,8,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Aw, man! Wait. Which half?",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,How do you know that?,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,I just do. It must be tough.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,"It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.",25,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,Yeah... Right. Next year.,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends.,11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,10,Cheers.,1,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,10,"Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.",15,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,"Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,10,"Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.",10,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,10,Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,10,It didn't. It tasted wrong.,5,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,10,Oops. We forgot to light the candles.,7,<strong>Steve</strong>
6,10,"And just as Barney looked away, it happened.",8,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,10,The Gentleman!,2,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,10,What happened? I saw it!,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,10,"Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.",17,<strong>Steve</strong>

6,11,"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?",13,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,Okay. That man is terrifying.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Keep smiling. He can still see us.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until...,14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Okay.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. <em></em> But the top half of his face...wants to murder you! Cheerful. Wants to murder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to murder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",72,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Whoa, he hates them.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Captain, quick question",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,Ooh. What-What is that?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,I don't get it.,4,<strong>Robin and Lily</strong>
6,11,He hates that he loves them.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,Running the water.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Holding the towel.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",31,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Rule number one,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Rule number two,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,11,Lubricant is public property.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Please.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite s*x.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"No doubt, Robo Cop.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,11,Oh! Sweet. No candles.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,11,Nah.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Wait. No. It had to be more than just, &quot;Nah.&quot; Oh, I think she said...",15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,You're a big... stupid octopus head!,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh... To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night...",44,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.",31,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?",27,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,It's totally okay.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. &quot;Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you&quot;&quot;I love your mom&quot;&quot;I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it&quot;&quot; Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",41,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,What's wrong with this shirt?,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",26,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. Now historically, they had three solid conversation topics",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,11,Did you catch the game last night?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Yeah. Nail-biter.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,...and cold weather sports.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,They are fun.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds.,10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Man, this is awkward.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",31,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,Can I get you two some drinks?,7,<strong>Waiter</strong>
6,11,Lots of drinks.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Oh, so many drinks.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um... something. Or was it that other thing?",18,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,Barney.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!",9,</strong> <em>crying</em>
6,11,Watch out!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,Wait. They were on the street.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,Watch out!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,I think I probably didn't.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes.",15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Like I said, the fight was just getting started.",9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.",6,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.",23,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!",17,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night.",18,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",37,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"Robin, I'm an attorney.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Fine. This night's a little awkward.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Why is that?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"So, who's the eye broccoli?",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,I'm sorry. Myth?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",89,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Did we bet on this?,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Let's say yes.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,Big-time manatee.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,What were those sailors thinking?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this.  Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.",39,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",16,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.",13,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney.",17,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,Want to hang?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,Nah. Watch out!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,You're a jerk.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time.",22,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.",8,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"How now? Oh, bother.  Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.",50,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,Head?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.",34,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.",10,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,</strong>,1,<strong>Ted
6,11,Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.,15,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump.",19,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,Ted?,1,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,Am I blushing or...?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' &quot;Part of Your World&quot; to my pants.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,I asked Barney the same thing.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Death?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Pregnancy?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,"Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.",43,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.",20,<strong>Liy</strong>
6,11,"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,"Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,That was it! I remember now!,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman &quot;fat&quot; right to her face!",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Oh... You're a jerk.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,What's that?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,Breast-feeding. Hot.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,Really?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,11,That's so sweet!,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,11,See kids? Told you I'd get it!,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Okay, now we're even!",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there.",12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,So you really thought I was gonna kill you?,9,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,Well... ish.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.",36,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.",33,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.,7,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,11,"You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking... I had fun.",19,<em>slurring</em>
6,11,"Yeah, me, too.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see...,19,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"Uh-oh. I don't feel so good.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,11,I really do.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,11,"And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever.",23,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,11,"Hey, Ted.",2,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,Hey. You feeling better?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.,10,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,You weren't?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.",31,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,"I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.",9,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,"Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,"Me, too.",2,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,"I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,No. Do you?,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,11,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,11,Still no sign of land.,5,<strong>Sailor #1</strong>
6,11,It's been 243 days since we've seen another living soul. What are you looking at?,15,<strong>Sailor #2</strong>

6,12,You're not pregnant.,3,<strong>Doctor</strong>
6,12,"Well, that did it.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours we all thought Lily was pregnant, and how it caused each of us to reexamine our own lives. Because while this was happening...",32,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,Are you sure you did it right?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"...I was on the phone with Punchy, my best friend from high school, who had recently asked me to be his best man.",23,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,12,I do wish you were a dude.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rifle and charge up the hill.",59,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,And how did that go again? Oh for one.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Ted.  Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of <em>Million Dollar Heads or Tails.</em>",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails was an extremely popular show with an extremely simple premise.",16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,"All right, your practice flip came up tails... But our Vegas oddsmaker tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50. And so, Jordan, for one million dollars......Heads... or tails? <em></em>",32,<strong>Animator</strong>

6,12,Currency rotation specialist.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,I am never drinking again.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"No, before that.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,12,I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Well, so could <em>Heads or Tails</em>. <em></em> The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on <em>The Bachelor</em>, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on <em>The Biggest Loser</em>, and now she's totally winning <em>Celebrity Rehab</em>.",40,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,12,I'm pregnant.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,What?!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them... For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself.",23,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,"Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.",56,Robin
6,12,"And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate.",11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,"Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,What changed your mind?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (<em>quietly)</em> Who gives her beer.",54,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,What?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,So the next day Robin called <strong>Heads or Tails</strong> to respectfully decline.,12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,"Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,But at that moment...,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,You're not pregnant.,3,<strong>Doctor</strong>

6,12,You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,You took the <em>Heads or tails</em> job?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,Yeah.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?",28,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,12,...This was happening.,3,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,And now she's totally winning <em>Celebrity Rehab</em>.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Bon Jovi?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n? <em></em> Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit.",28,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.",31,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Hey, guys. Big announcement.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,Thirty?!,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,I'm pregnant.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,What?!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?,47,Barney
6,12,we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight, (<em>imitating Oprah</em>) is Barney's Favorite Things!",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got.,12,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,Huh? I don't know what that is.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,The next hour got pretty weird.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,Velour track suits!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club! (<em>Applause, cheering)</em> You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more.",68,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island.",28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,"Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless...",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"What's up, Barney?",3,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney.",21,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,"No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe.",7,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,"I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews.",30,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,"Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero...",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,You're not pregnant.,3,<strong>Doctor</strong>
6,12,"...Zero... (<em>Cell phone chimes</em>) Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.",36,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"That's great. Thank you, Barney!",5,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,"Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,What happened to giving the money away?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. (<em>Chuckles)</em> Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,Let's back up one last time.,6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,I'm pregnant.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,What?!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now.",47,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my v*g1n*!",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,What am I doing with my life?,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,What am I doing with my life?,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,They're totally onto us. What do we do?,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense!",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,Narrator,1,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,12,"Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!",50,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,Nursery's painted!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,Blue? What if it's a girl?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,Damn it!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Oh, God, it's 8",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?!",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"No, I can't keep it together!",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong!,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,The iPod was on shuffle! <em>(Rock music stops</em>) The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!,17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips.",27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Marshall, I don't like this.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away!",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,You're not pregnant.,3,<strong>Doctor</strong>
6,12,"Well, that did it.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,I know this probably comes as quite a disappointment.,9,<strong>Doctor</strong>
6,12,Yeah. Huge bummer.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,So disappointing.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,Are you guys okay?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,Don't reach into the living room!,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,"Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,"Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,Get a puppy!,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,No!,1,<em>yelling</em>
6,12,Oh. Our movie snack.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!",58,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,Marshall and Lily got in trouble.,6,<em>singsongy</em>
6,12,"And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.",45,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!,21,Ted
6,12,"So, if I get a large popcorn, you want to go split-skees or...",13,<em>stuttering</em>
6,12,And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work,23,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,Hello.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Ted, I can't get married!",5,<strong>Punchy</strong>

6,12,"You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!",6,<strong>Punchy</strong>
6,12,"One for <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em>, please. Thank you.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,We're idiots.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,This kid doesn't stand a chance.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,We're ready for this.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,We're ready for this.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point?,14,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,Nope.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I.D. badge.",33,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,12,You sure?,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,12,Positive.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,12,And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,Yeah. Why?,2,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,"Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Thank you, son.",3,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,Son?!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad.,9,<strong>Sam</strong>
6,12,Congratulations.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,It's what I do.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,"Big mistake, but go on.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,Are you asking what I think you're asking?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Ted, will you be my best man?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,12,Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,12,"Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",57,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,12,"Um, no.",2,<strong>Woman</strong>

6,13,"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,And how long have you been trying?,7,<strong>Doctor</strong>
6,13,Six days.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"But then, months went by, and still nothing happened.",9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city.",21,<strong>Doctor</strong>
6,13,"Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected s*x day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",26,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",42,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,I'm not playing laser tag.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,Damn it.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,And Marshall's the winner.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City.",23,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,So I understand you want to get pregnant.,8,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"Yeah, and it cuts in and out.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,Ooh! How did you do it?,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?",20,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,What are you talking about?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,What are you talking about?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,We'll look at all the factors that contribute to fertility,10,<strong>Strangel</strong>
6,13,"Just one, &quot;Dr. Stangel&quot;. Where'd you get the beard?",9,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,13,"Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",54,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,Or... or cost-saving alternative,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,I still kind of think it's Barney.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,There's no way it's Barney.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,13,"It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,Would you...? I...,3,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin.",16,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,He checks out. I really don't have time for this.,10,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the v*g1n*.",11,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,Okay. Convinced.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up.",13,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,&quot;Suit up&quot;... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Baby, you just saw Barney.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Oh, yeah... Bjorney.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.",22,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results.",14,<strong>Strangel</strong>

6,13,Can we leave him in here for a while?,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.,13,<strong>Strangel</strong>
6,13,"Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate.",35,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,13,"Everyone, say hello to your new research associate Robin Scherbatsky.",10,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,13,"Hi, guys.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"Oh, here comes our new Hardfire host. Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.",12,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,13,Sandy Rivers?!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,Sandy Rivers... Robin's old co-host and my old nemesis.,9,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,We should have s*x.,4,<strong>Sandy</strong>

6,13,It gets worse.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"Sandy, this is...",3,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,13,Robin.,1,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,You two know each other?,5,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,13,Know each other? We've had s*x.,6,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,You had s*x with Sandy Rivers?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"Hey, babe.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Yeah, uh, we got a game of &quot;Go Fish&quot; going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.",37,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.,21,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"So, second day of work?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,What's wrong?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Already? Oh, honey.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,I wish I was the office slut.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Yes. We definitely had s*x.,5,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,We did not have s*x.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Then why do I remember you?,6,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,"I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have s*x.",11,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,Thank you.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop...,18,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,We did have s*x.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor.",10,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,But this reporter takes pride in...,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"Robin, a word of advice",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney guns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",39,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"Oh, it's my dad.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,Aren't you going to get it?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,He has to do that?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,I'm getting married!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,Yeah...!,1,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,I passed the bar!,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,All right!,2,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,"I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,That's what I'm talking about!,5,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"I'll show you. &quot;Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion&quot;.",39,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,13,"And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius.,8,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,"Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.",28,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,A few?,2,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,"Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Gregory.,1,<strong>Sandy</strong>

6,13,"Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.",34,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me.",24,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,Show me &quot;owl attack&quot;.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.,21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised.",52,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"All yours, buddy. The thing you're about to do in here... I did that in here, too. Three minutes ago.",20,<strong>Man #1</strong>

6,13,"Sure, you could, but, uh... we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.",23,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,Surprise!,1,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,Surprise!,1,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,13,Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you.,14,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,13,"For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes?",9,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,"Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.",29,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.",19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,"Thank you, baby. You're the best.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it!",36,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,13,That's why Fred Cox is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had.,12,<strong>Marvin</strong>

6,13,"Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,Who?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Sorry. You said &quot;who&quot;. It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. &quot;Who&quot;. Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.,36,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,Ah... You're not the pizza guy.,6,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,"Oh, my God. This is...",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.",35,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming?",43,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,13,This isn't working.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Where you going, son?",4,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,I'm... I'm going to... I'm... I'm going to...,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Kids, to this day, your uncle Marshall is thankful for what Lily said next.",14,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,He's going to m*st*rb*t*.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,Lily!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Marshall, just tell them what's going on.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,13,And so Marshall told his parents everything.,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,"And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm?",33,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,13,"Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"What I'm saying is, we love you no matter what. Now, why don't you pretend you're in high school, get back in that bathroom, and &quot;blow dry your hair&quot;.",29,<strong>Marvin</strong>
6,13,"Wait, you knew?",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.",7,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,13,So? Possibly last day of work?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Actually, it was a good day.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls?",18,<strong>Sandy</strong>
6,13,"Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Yes! Put him in a body bag!,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Okay, I didn't do it.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of...,16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,Owl?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice.",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,13,"That day, Robin decided to steer into the skid. And though she never quite shook the nickname, Sparkles went on to do very well at World Wide News. Especially after this happened.",32,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,"After his parents had gone back to Minnesota, Marshall got the results of his test.",15,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,13,"I'm afraid I have some very bad news, Marshall. Judging from the results of your test, it is... it is very unlikely that you'll be able to father a child.",30,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"Oh, God.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"I know, I know.",4,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,It's just...,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Now... in some rare cases, a regimen change can fix the problem, so I'm recommending a spirited cardio routine. Preferably with a partner, involving any light-based firearm activity in the Tri-State area. Poughkeepsie, for example. Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport known as laser tag? Surprise!",47,<strong>Stangel</strong>
6,13,"Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,13,"Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,13,"Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"Yeah, go ahead.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,13,"Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,13,"You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it?",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,14,You remembered my birthday!,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,14,"Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal?",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,Yes.,1,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,14,"Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called &quot;German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.&quot;",43,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,14,"Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old.",17,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,"Whoa, they grow big out here.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,14,And here's your phone number back.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,14,"Judy, I...",2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,14,I did it.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,What possible excuse could you have for this?,8,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,"There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm!",20,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,"That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,"Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.,18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,14,Stupid.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,14,Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?<em></em> So that's it? No discussion?,24,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,"I'm not going to listen. &quot;Rent Crocodile Dundee II&quot; are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.",29,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,Is he laughing?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,"Marshall really did think he could live with that. That is, until later, at the memorial service.",17,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,14,My last talk with Marvin was so lovely.,8,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,The stories his mother and brothers told were so perfect.,10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,14,"Then he picked my crying son up off the ice. He gave him a hug and said, &quot;Champ, it doesn't matter if you fall down once in a while.&quot;",29,<strong>Marshall's brother #1</strong>
6,14,"And as we hiked, a little deer appeared on the path. She hopped over to Dad and started eating-- right out of his hand.",24,<strong>Marshall's brother #2</strong>
6,14,And then he kissed me and he said...,8,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,&quot;I will always be proud of you&quot;&quot;,7,<strong>Marshall's brother #1</strong>
6,14,&quot;Life is such a gift.&quot;,5,<strong>Marshall's brother #2</strong>
6,14,"&quot;You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive.&quot;",9,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,Lame.,1,his voice breaking</em>
6,14,These stories suck.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,14,"You're up next, baby.",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,I just need some air.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Baby, are you okay?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing.,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,She's right. Your dad was hilarious.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,14,"You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (<em>scratchy electronic sounds)</em> Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. <em></em> But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?",159,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound? (<em>laughing)</em> Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you.",38,<strong>Marvin's voice</strong>
6,14,Looks like your dad came through one last time.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,&quot;I love you.&quot; My father's last words to me are &quot;I love you.&quot;,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Ooh, and let me know if you find my foot cream. That fungus thing is acting up again.",18,<strong>Marvin's voice</strong>
6,14,&quot;I love you.&quot; My father's last words to me are &quot;I love you.&quot;,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear.",10,<strong>Everyone</strong>
6,14,"Bye, Pop.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"So Marshall finally got up to speak. Funny thing, though...",10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,14,Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,He decided to keep Marvin's real last words just for himself.,11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,14,Thanks.,1,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,For what?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it.,12,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,Any time.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,"That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one.",14,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,14,"Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,"Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.",36,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,14,"Last words-- it's a lot of pressure, kids.",8,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,14,"Hi, Dad.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,14,"Hi, Dad.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,14,"Hi, Dad.",2,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,15,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, that is too cute. Say it again.",8,<em>laughing</em>
6,15,"No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Kids, remember. Zoey had tried to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design. And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends. Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.",50,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,15,I thought the oven was Celsius.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,It's okay. We got hot dogs.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,Could someone pass the ketchup?,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,I hope I can pass this hot dog.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Oh.Oops.,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.",8,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Which is all gone.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"All right, I tell you what... you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three.",16,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Hmm, tell you what... no dice.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,I'll get the next hundred.,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,You're not getting out of this.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,You want to go on a date with my hot cousin?,11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,I'll get the ketchup.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Finally, Ted called her up.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Hello.,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,You still want to do that?,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,&quot;Cute&quot; means &quot;fat&quot;&quot;,3,<em>coughing</em>
6,15,She's not fat.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>

6,15,I take back everything I said. That girl is extremely attractive.,11,<em>coughing</em>
6,15,"Hey, Zoey.",2,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Hey. Ted, this is my cousin...",6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name. None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as...",31,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,15,Honey.,1,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,And here's why...,3,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,15,"She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, &quot;Oh, honey.&quot;",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Interesting. Show your work.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,My apartment building is so safe. My landlord... he even installed a security camera in my shower.,17,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince.",19,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends.,18,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.",9,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...",36,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.",14,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.",15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.",5,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,Why do they call 'em coasters?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,And Barney.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Okay, time to go home.",5,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,What are you talking about?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.",9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?,16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Mm-hmm.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.",29,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Hmm?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,He's gay!,2,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,15,"Mom, hang up!",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,I'm sorry.,2,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,15,Go on.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Hmm?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,I'm in love with Zoey.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Oh, my God.",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, my God!",3,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,15,Mom!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Sorry.,1,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,15,"Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Funny you should say that.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Does anyone know why we're here?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, who called this intervention?",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Finally.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Are you sure it's love?,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...<em></em> I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love.",32,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next?,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Isn't that a little harsh?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Then what am I supposed to do?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.",48,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Fine. I'll shut 'em down.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,So don't answer it.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Yeah.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota. You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude.",18,<em>with a Minnesotan accent</em>
6,15,"Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Hey, Marshall.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Barney. W- What number is this?,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.",46,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Hey, Zoey.",2,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Ted, this is my cousin...",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Honey.,1,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,Uh... Robin's version was...,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.",5,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...",16,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,15,"Okay, time to go home.",5,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Who's your daddy?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Okay, can we skip this part, please?",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Sure, I'll just summarize it. <em></em>",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Okay, that's been going on a while.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Thanks.,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?",7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (<em>imitating squeaky bedsprings)</em>",41,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,She hugged me. What was that all about?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Zoey's in love with Ted.,5,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,Marcus!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.",79,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut?",17,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,"Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.",11,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,"So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.",23,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Hello.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.,21,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Can I get you a beer?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way.",16,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, my God.",3,</strong> <em>laughing</em>
6,15,"What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What?",11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?",8,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,15,Mom! Get off the phone!,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Could you get some more Bugles, please?",7,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,"Of course, dear.",3,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,15,"Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Wow. Okay.,2,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,And that was it. No more Zoey.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Ted's a son of a bitch!  Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Why?,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Lily hates you.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,You hate me?,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,That's crazy. I don't hate you.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.",11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.,19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.",21,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.,29,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,I don't know.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Well, you did the right thing, baby.",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Not entirely.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,And that's Robin on the other line.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,15,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Me? You dragged me into this?!,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...,15,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,"Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Just don't answer it.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,I can't not answer. It's impolite.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Marshall, you can beat this.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,I can't turn my back on politeness.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,15,Good manners are what separate us from those &quot;elbows on the table&quot; Wisconsinites.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,15,"Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first.",51,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Hi.,1,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Listen, um, about Barney...",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.",7,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,Who's your daddy?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,Oh... Who's your daddy?,4,<em>giggling</em>
6,15,I don't know.,3,</strong> <em>sobbing</em>
6,15,I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.,19,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.,31,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey.",2,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.",38,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,Four. Four Nobel Prizes.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?",12,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,Only three.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,15,"Well, there you go.",4,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?",22,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.",21,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,I am her therapist.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Oh! Well, in that case...",5,<strong>Honey</strong>
6,15,"Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,What's this really about?,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,I told you. Lily hates you.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.",24,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,All right. Yes. I... hate you.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Great. See? Was that so hard?,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Zoey.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.",22,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?",34,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,Zoey's in love with...,4,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,"Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...",40,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.",15,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.",15,<strong>Marcus</strong>
6,15,Give me that phone.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,15,"Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? <em></em> Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.",53,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye.",9,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,Why was Marshall calling?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,Don't worry about it. Go on.,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,"Well, actually... <em></em>",3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,You're a show-off.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,15,You better take that.,4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,15,"Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,16,I'm getting weird!,3,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,16,"Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,16,"Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...",46,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,16,"Uh, I'll talk to him.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,16,"I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.",22,<strong>Judy</strong>
6,16,"Oh, God.",2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,16,"There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?",19,<strong>Judy</strong>

6,16,We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,16,Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.,11,<strong>Anna</strong>
6,16,"</strong> What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",24,<strong>Robin
6,16,But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.,4,<strong>Bev</strong>
6,16,</strong> I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,9,<strong>Robin
6,16,"Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.",21,<strong>Anna</strong>
6,16,"</strong> I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.",18,<strong>Barney
6,16,"Well, I think I'm heading out, too.",7,<strong>Nora</strong>
6,16,"</strong> What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!",12,<strong>Barney
6,16,"It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.",27,<strong>Nora</strong>
6,16,</strong> Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,8,<strong>Robin
6,16,</strong> What are you talking about?,6,<strong>Barney
6,16,"</strong> Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",26,<strong>Robin
6,16,"</strong> No, I don't. She's gross.",6,<strong>Barney
6,16,</strong> Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,11,<strong>Robin

6,16,"And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except...",25,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,16,Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.,16,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,16,"Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,16,"</strong> The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",22,<strong>Barney

6,17,I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,17,Totally.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?",25,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,17,"Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...",5,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,17,"No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.",28,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Oh, man, this movie is scary.",6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,17,"I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",45,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,17,Yeah?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,17,"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,Nora met a guy. What?!,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,What?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"But &quot;L'Amour&quot; means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,I can't sleep.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,17,Wow.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,Do you have any idea who it could be?,9,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true.,20,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,17,"Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.",58,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.",20,<strong>Captain</strong>

6,17,I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.,13,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,Me. I'm the bad guy.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,Damn it! The box!,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,17,"Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",59,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,Sorry?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",25,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,17,You did meet Sting.,4,<strong>Man</strong>
6,17,"Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million?",14,<strong>Arthur</strong>

6,17,"Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?,5,<strong>Arthur</strong>

6,17,His father just died.,4,<strong>Man</strong>
6,17,...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.,7,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,17,Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,"No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",24,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"Hey, baby.",2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,Yeah?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,"Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,"Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,Cwap.,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"Hi, I'm here to pick up...",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Hello, Ted.",2,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,To the study?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.,7,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,Know what?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!",47,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!",40,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,"No, no, no, you can't fire him.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!,7,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,"Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!",16,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,"Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Whoa, &quot;rapscallion&quot; may be going a bit far, Ted.",9,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,"But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",49,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?",19,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,21,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.",12,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,"Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.",7,<strong>Captain</strong>
6,17,It's me. You're welcome.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Okay, baby, what gives?",4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"All right, Robin, give it to me.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, &quot;Yeah, Barney, go get her!&quot; But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",48,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,"It's a five, idiot.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,&quot;Moon man language&quot;? What does that even mean?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,How am I supposed to see that's a five?,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,Look how you taped this up...,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,17,Barney. Go get her.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,17,"Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.",22,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,17,So I'm the bad guy. Great.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.",39,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,17,If you say so.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,17,"I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.",20,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,17,"Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,He'll never get to see how I turn out.,9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,What do you mean?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",61,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",26,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,"Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",49,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,17,Meeker doesn't hate you.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,17,"Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it...",39,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,17,Are you guys...?,3,<strong>Meeker</strong>
6,17,Closed. Sorry. Thanks.,3,<strong>Wendy</strong>
6,17,Rough night?,2,<strong>Meeker</strong>
6,17,Yeah.,1,<strong>Wendy</strong>
6,17,I'm sorry.,2,<strong>Meeker</strong>
6,17,It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.,12,<strong>Wendy</strong>

6,17,"No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",44,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,18,Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.,18,<strong>The cardiologist</strong>

6,18,"And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.",10,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,18,What happened at 8,4,<strong>The cardiologist</strong>
6,18,"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,18,"This might be a little forward, but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest?",16,<strong>Nora</strong>
6,18,"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,18,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,18,"I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives.

6,18,"No, I didn't say, &quot;He a dawg.&quot; I said, &quot;He's a dog.&quot; As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>

6,18,"Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you &quot;paws.&quot;",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,18,How did you meet?,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,18,Tell us the &quot;tail&quot;,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,18,"Yes, how did you &quot;whisker&quot; off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,18,"Did you send her an e-mail, or did you &quot;collar&quot;?",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,18,"</strong> Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.",8,<strong>Robin

6,18,"So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty &quot;ruff.&quot;",11,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,18,"I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,18,How many do you want?,5,<strong>Nora</strong>
6,18,Three... one of each. You?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,18,Three. All in an old stone house.,7,<strong>Nora</strong>

6,18,I really am.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,18,Unbelievable.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,18,"I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.",32,<strong>Nora</strong>
6,18,"I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...",9,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,18,"I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,18,"Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,18,"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,18,"Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,18,"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?",18,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,18,I don't recall.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,18,"Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?",38,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,18,"It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?",32,<strong>Nora</strong>
6,18,This was a big deal for Barney.,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>

6,19,Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon.

6,19,"Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,19,"Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.",44,<strong>Jerry</strong>

6,19,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.,19,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"Oh, that's cool.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?",11,<strong>Jerry</strong>

6,19,"First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",44,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,19,"Milk, skim.",2,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,19,Wow.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9",19,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right",18,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.",9,<strong>Jerry</strong>

6,19,I was out of control.,5,<strong>Jerry</strong>

6,19,"So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.",20,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.,32,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word &quot;furgling.&quot; It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, &quot;More quiche! More quiche!&quot; I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.",56,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...",14,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.",10,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,Big-time.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",35,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the &quot;Father Knows Breast,&quot; there's the &quot;Bush Dynasty,&quot; the &quot;Lick Father, Lick Son.&quot;",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.",7,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,Why?,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.",33,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.",36,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,</strong> We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,21,<strong>Lily

6,19,You're having dinner with him tonight.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,Are you sure it's not more than that?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,19,"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,19,"Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. <em>(She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees)</em> I'm literally 11 inches from you.",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance.,11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,19,Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.,19,<strong>Cherryl</strong>

6,19,"Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.",11,<strong>Cherryl</strong>
6,19,"Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,</strong> Guess now we wait.,5,<strong>Lily
6,19,"Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,19,"Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",30,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"</strong> What, baby?",3,<strong>Lily
6,19,You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,That's not true.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,19,"</strong> Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",6,<strong>Lily
6,19,I'm sorry.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,19,I first noticed it at the bar.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"Hey, Lily, (<em>his voice cracks</em>) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",49,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"It ages well, that's the thing.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,You guys like my new soul patch?,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"Righteous hair tab, brotha.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>

6,19,"J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.",30,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.",14,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,19,"Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.",8,<strong>JJ</strong>
6,19,"J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,"Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,"Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,19,"Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, &quot;do the laundry&quot;",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,19,</strong> You can't swallow pills.,5,<strong>Lily

6,19,"So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.",13,<strong>Cherryl</strong>
6,19,"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,19,I'm 11.,2,<strong>JJ</strong>

6,20,"No, you hang up.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"No, you hang up.",4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,"No, you hang up! (<em>Later)</em> No, you hang up.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"No, you hang up.",4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,"No, you...  Hold on.  Hello?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,Why would you do that?!,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,I-I thought you'd like it.,5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,Who likes that?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,I like it.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,Your relationship sounds exhausting.,4,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything.",28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,20,I have to quit.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,Quit GNB?! Why?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",36,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Baby, you have my full support.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,I don't think you know what Spain is.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,It's dinero.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,Where? I want his autograph!,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB.",41,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,20,It's graduation goggles.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",63,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,The guy who was basically a dog?,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful.,22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",27,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",27,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. <em></em>",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,It starts with an... &quot;L?&quot;,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,How can you not remember my name?,7,<strong>Girl</strong>
6,20,It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Well, they don't do that all the time.",8,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,"Yes, they do.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"No, they don't.",3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,"Yes, they do. It's like they...",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,... don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally.,7,<strong>Lily and Marshall</strong>
6,20,It rhymes with your name.,5,<strong>Girl</strong>
6,20,And I said my name was...?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.",20,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Oh, good for you, sweetie.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",50,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",18,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play &quot;Who's Hot and Who's Scott?&quot;",30,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Guys, everything's ruined.",3,<strong>Man</strong>
6,20,What? Why?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.",42,<strong>Man</strong>
6,20,"...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.",20,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey?,17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you?,17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,It's not.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, &quot;What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?&quot;",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, &quot;Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?&quot;",33,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,We take turns! Sometimes.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",14,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,Hershel?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,20,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Barney, I'm not playing...",4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,Just come back to GNB already!,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,I'm really loving my new job.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?",25,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Baby, you have my full support.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Thanks, baby. (<em>phone chirps)</em> Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.",39,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,That's how I'm gonna use mine.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. &quot;Barney, we have to talk about your father.&quot; &quot;Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil.&quot; &quot;Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session &quot;between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute.&quot; I don't need this!",56,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One",25,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? <em></em> Perfect. Let's go.",39,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",52,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"<em></em> Oh, my God!",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,How long have you been there?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,You don't remember?,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",24,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Oh, no, I'm fine.",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,Yeah.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Right. So, um... Chinese?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",23,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,But I thought you liked being challenged.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",45,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (<em>Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)</em>",35,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.,10,<strong>Man</strong>
6,20,"Um, he speaks perfect English.",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Yeah, I-I know.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,Then why did you ask me to come?,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",28,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"You were right. If I hear myself say &quot;Baby, you have my full support&quot; one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone!",23,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",39,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",20,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",65,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,Lil...,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. <em></em>",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"My bag? Oh, no. I got it.",7,<strong>Man</strong>
6,20,There's nothing to talk about.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"I don't want to talk about it, okay?",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,Why not?,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,23,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking...",107,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",19,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,Huh?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",17,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",48,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"...</strong>he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (<em>quiet sobbing</em>) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",41,<strong>Barney
6,20,What is wrong with you?,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,20,"Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations?",15,<strong>Prof. Rodriguez</strong>
6,20,"Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(<em>sighs)</em> Lily...",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",31,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",95,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Baby, you have my full support.",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,Ted.,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,Hey! What are you doing here?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.",13,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,This you can be supportive of?!,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,What is that supposed to mean?,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,"I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend!",27,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,20,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?",17,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,20,"And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then... Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way.",67,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,20,You're too young. This isn't fair.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,20,"We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"Thank you, Marshall.  Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?",12,<em>weakly</em>
6,20,"Yes, of course, of course... anything.",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,Eat this meatball sub.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,I don't have much time!,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,20,"Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,20,"I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!",40,<em>with a mean laugh</em>

6,21,"And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...",13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,21,"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Mmm. Your dad?,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,My dad!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Barney Stinson.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,21,"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... &quot;Crazy Jerry&quot;? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?",52,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,You do not know how right you are.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",17,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",34,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time.

6,21,"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",15,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,That's why you brought these guys.,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,No. That's why I brought these guys. <em></em> I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,24,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,21,Yeah.,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",18,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",46,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Whoo-hoo!,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,Gross!,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",33,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, &quot;Man is least himself when he talks...&quot;",24,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,21,Ah. You're right... &quot;No quoting Oscar Wilde.&quot;,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Aw, man! Why?",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.",40,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",25,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,How good was that movie?,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,And... hence new identities.,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,And so Barney's dad finally showed up.,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,21,"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",15,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Lily, his wife.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,That's... a little depressing.,4,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",19,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Two, three, four!",3,ROBIN
6,21,"So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?",14,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",9,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Oh, no.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Oh, No shut down, too.",5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,There's Where?,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Where's Where?,2,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Where's where Was was, isn't it?",6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Okay.,1,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,Not Okay. That place is lame.,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,5,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Guys, focus.",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Where?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Not Where. Focus.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,I thought Focus was closed.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,So Closed is open.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"No, Closed is closed.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,I don't know. Third base! Right?,6,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"I'll go anyplace, okay?",4,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,Not Okay. Okay is lame.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"Guys, shut up.",3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Guys, just pick a club, okay?",6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,Not Okay!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Okay is Lame! Gay bar.,5,<strong>All</strong>
6,21,"For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lam√©.",16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"It's hopeless, isn't it?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,I might be allergic to this stamp.,7,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.",8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Mila Kunis?!,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,"No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?,12,<strong>Man</strong>
6,21,"Uh... no. <em></em> The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.",23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,I was trying on the pants.,6,<strong>Man</strong>
6,21,Oh. <em></em>,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",29,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?,17,<strong>Man</strong>
6,21,"Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,I should be so lucky.,5,<strong>Man</strong>
6,21,Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.,10,<strong>Man</strong>
6,21,"Mm-hmm. You, too.",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Yeah.,1,<strong>Man</strong>
6,21,You owe me one.,4,<em>whispering to Robin</em>
6,21,"Man, isn't this place great?",5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!",7,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.",26,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,My goodness!,2,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.",11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!,12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your &quot;real job.&quot;,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,I won a Tony!,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,I brought French cooking to America!,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,What?,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,Let's do shots.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.",20,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? &quot;Never stop partying.&quot;,17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.,10,</strong> <em>looking horrified</em>
6,21,"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?",25,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,But I want to hang out with you.,8,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? <em></em> There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in.,21,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,Oh...,1,<strong>All</strong>
6,21,"Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!",29,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,Can you believe it? This is awesome!,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Barney, how is that awesome?",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?,19,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,21,"Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have s*x in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have s*x in the bathroom.",38,<strong>Marhsall</strong>
6,21,So our usual wager. Deal.,5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,21,"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?",13,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"No, of course not. I... I just...",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!",17,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!",12,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Okay. &quot;I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.&quot; There. What's the rush?,13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?",26,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,You're a doofus and a half.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,At a close-out sale at Dawes.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Really? I remember that sale.,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"Hey, Robin.",2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"Oh, Ted. Oh, no.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,Look what I just bought. Right? Right?,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great s*x that night. Great s*x.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. <em></em>,10,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,21,You were picturing your crush!,5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,21,"Well, somebody had to.",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,21,"Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?",18,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,21,"After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy.",11,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,21,"You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!",14,</strong> <em>to a big tattoed biker</em>
6,21,,0,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!",10,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,Oh...!,1,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,I just puked on the hood of that... police car!,10,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.",24,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...",22,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,21,I... I just puked on the hood of that... (<em>siren blares</em>)...police car.,12,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"Well, why do all those things?",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"I figured if I showed you what... &quot;never stop partying&quot; really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well.",22,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,12,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,21,How did you do it?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,Do what?,2,<strong>Jerry</strong>
6,21,"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",22,<strong>Barney</strong>

6,21,Maybe I've met her already.,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,21,"And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.",26,<strong>Jerry</strong>

6,22,Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,9,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,That's it!,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,Kent! Kent!,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!",12,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"That's what you get, you traitor!",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Oh, really? Really?",3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,Yeah. Really.,2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,Really. That... what...,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.",8,<strong>Carl</strong>
6,22,Ejected!,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!,12,<strong>Carl</strong>
6,22,"Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. <em>(The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth)</em> Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.",36,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Man, what are we going to do without her?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Oh...,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",21,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Ten, nine, eight...",3,<strong>All</strong>
6,22,"I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,Happy New Year!,3,<strong>All</strong>
6,22,"If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.,24,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.",27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,How about martinis?,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.,11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Why not?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",27,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Every time.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Uh-huh.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?",8,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.,12,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"I keep telling you, that didn't happen.",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,13,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out.,11,<em>talking to a mirror</em>
6,22,"Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Peppermint schnapps?,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Who?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.",16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...",14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Hey, where are our chicken wings?",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Show me chicken wings!,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Good order, Ted! Good order!",5,<strong>All</strong>
6,22,"Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at beatboxing.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"Peace, I'm out.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Peace. I'm out.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"You had to take that away from me, didn't you? <em></em>",11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.",17,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,What do you mean?,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,14,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Stop.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Man, how did things get so screwed up?",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits.,35,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,22,You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,I thought we weren't talking about...,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",33,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?,11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",42,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.",21,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Okay.,1,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",29,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,18,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,16,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"Oh, my God.",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",49,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.,14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,That's not a chocolate.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",18,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",24,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",21,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"It made me wonder, &quot;What could I have done to make him stay?&quot;",13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",10,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,Wow. That got real o'clock.,5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Dance, my puppets, dance!",4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Oh, God, totally!",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?",16,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,This bathroom for entire floor!,5,<strong>Woman</strong>
6,22,Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",22,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",15,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,What? What is it?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.,14,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Kids, don't drink tequila.",4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,22,"Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having s*x next door... with a third very small man.",48,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.,12,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Okay. What is it? And don't give me, &quot;It's beautiful.&quot; Don't give me, &quot;It's magnificent&quot; What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",29,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here.,13,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Why, why have you never told me that?",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.",90,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Kids, you never forget the first time or place you tell a girl",13,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,22,I love you.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"I love you, too.",4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up.",18,<strong>Carl</strong>
6,22,"Well, what drink finally did the trick?",7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"Of course, beer.",3,<strong>Robin &amp; Lily</strong>
6,22,I love you.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,I love you.,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Uh, no. N-Not right...",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.",9,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that?",15,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,What was what?,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,I think it went under the bed.,7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,I don't see anything.,4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"That, that was... that!",4,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,The what?,2,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.",26,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!,8,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,22,"Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.",10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Morning. Who wants breakfast?,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?,13,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!",30,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,I thought they made up last night.,7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,"Damn it, I know what happened.",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,I love you.,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,22,"I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...",7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Carl, a round of champagne.",5,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,Ooh! The champagne.,3,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,16,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,22,"Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,22,"Okay, what drink can fix this?",6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?,16,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,I got it.,3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Right?,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,22,Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...,10,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,22,What is that?,3,<strong>Woman</strong>

6,23,"Kids, this is a story of landmarks. There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all.",74,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember",21,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.",6,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,I just have...,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's killing me. What rhymes with &quot;beck and call?&quot;",43,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,Ah...,1,<strong>Audience</strong>
6,23,Thank you.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question.",16,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,"Actually, it a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said...",20,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,&quot;Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark.&quot; And then the crowd gasps,12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?,10,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,Almost exclusively. But here's my point,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.",16,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,"I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",8,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...,7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,Nice.,1,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,I have a message from Barney.,6,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened.,16,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,And then this happened.,4,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!",24,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,"Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Which led to this happening.,5,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.",14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,"Mmm. Love you, too.",4,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",17,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,"Yeah, I have that, too.",5,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Damn it.,2,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,"All right, here's the message. (<em>clears throat, then reads Barney's note)</em> &quot;Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and...&quot; Really? &quot;Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. <em></em> Do evil laugh.&quot; Oh, um... <em>(makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh)</em> So, what are you turds up to?",109,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,"Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",28,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,Why does it need to rhyme?,6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",13,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,Yeah. It's why in our apartment,6,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,And she hasn't since.,4,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,Nailed it.,2,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",26,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",49,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,7,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,What?,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",22,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",12,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,I once knew such a girl.,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,It was last call. In this very bar.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",13,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,"Barney, this is about the building.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Come on. This is so about the girl.,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",55,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,11,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,"Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",13,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be.  That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",24,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.",26,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.",24,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,Isn't that animal cruelty?,4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,I'm talking about my wife.,5,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Yeah, I know your friend Ted.",6,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? <em></em> Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...",37,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.",11,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,Come again for Big Fudge?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",32,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,8,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?,9,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,By being the best architect available?,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,No.,1,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,By... being Latino?,3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.,12,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",11,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,Damn it! I was kidding?,5,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",17,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.",18,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,Damn it!,2,<strong>Both</strong>
6,23,"No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.",21,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,11,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,And he's been doing it for years.,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",7,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,No idea.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,He has a lot of keys.,6,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",11,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",92,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,The chairman asks you...,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,9,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,You say...,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,No.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,7,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,We're done here.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,There's the second scenario.,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,The chairman asks you...,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,9,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,You say...,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Yes,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",43,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,We're done here.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,You said there was a third scenario.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Right.,1,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,The chairman asks you...,4,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,9,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,23,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,29,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,"Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... <em></em>",19,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Tree?,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,"Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",46,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",9,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,Thank you.,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",46,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,Thank you.,2,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,"That night, as I slept soundly...",6,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"Barney, what are you doing?",5,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream...",22,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,34,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words",13,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,"Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",12,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,I am not... Barney...,4,<em>shouting dramatically</em>
6,23,Whoa! Lighting change!,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy.",25,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,"Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",35,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn.",24,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,"The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Indeed.,1,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Mo' buildings, mo' problems.",4,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,"This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.",6,<strong>Ghost</strong>
6,23,"Dream! Dream! It was just a dream. <em>(He takes his breath again, then phones Zoey)</em> Hey. I know it's late, but, uh... you want to meet up?",27,<em>panting</em>
6,23,"Hello, Mr. Lion.",3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,"&quot;Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair&quot;&quot;",8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Hey, I met you right...(<em>laughs)</em>...here.",5,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.",21,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,Worth every penny.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...,21,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,"No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.,14,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,Exactly.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,You okay?,2,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,Yeah. Good night.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark?",16,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,"No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",22,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? (<em>She plays a recorder)</em>",26,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of... wieners and gonads.,26,<em>on recorder</em>
6,23,"Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?",6,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,"Yeah, that's me.",3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",24,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,Yeah.,1,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",18,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",27,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,We should totally buy a bar!,6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,7,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,It's really the only sensible idea right now.,8,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,"Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",11,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,8,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,I'll allow it!,3,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"The only court where you show up, then get served.",10,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,9,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,That's not bad.,3,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,21,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,"Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. <em></em> And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?",46,<strong>Marshall</strong>
6,23,"Oh, this ought to be good.",6,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,And then Lily told us her plan.,7,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"Oh, this is good!",4,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,We have to find Arthur right now.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!",18,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"Hey, Arthur!",2,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Oh, cute dog!",3,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,23,"No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!",41,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",16,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,"Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!",30,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"Uh... Hey, Arthur?",3,<strong>Barney</strong>
6,23,I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?,14,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,"Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",30,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,Dibs.,1,<strong>Barney and Ted</strong>
6,23,Fine! What's the idea?,4,<strong>Arthur</strong>
6,23,Well...,1,<strong>Lily</strong>
6,23,"Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict.",28,<strong>Ted from 2030</strong>
6,23,"Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied.",65,<strong>Chairman</strong>
6,23,Zoey... Zoey!,2,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,"All right, what do you have to say for yourself?",10,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.,15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,23,We're done here.,3,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,23,"Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.",18,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,24,"Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",6,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,24,That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,10,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,24,"I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.",11,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,24,Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,7,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,24,"Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",14,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,24,Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?,7,<strong>Zoey</strong>
6,24,You know that &quot;coffee&quot; is code for &quot;I want to get back together&quot; right?,14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,24,"Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",15,<strong>Ted</strong>
6,24,I want to get back together.,6,<strong>Zoey</strong>

6,24,"Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",14,<strong>Robin</strong>
6,24,"Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, &quot;Get sick, get a free gallon of soup&quot;.",19,<strong>Lily</strong>

6,24,Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,10,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,24,"Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot.",34,<strong>Rod</strong>
6,24,"50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",31,<strong>Ted</strong>

6,24,There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,22,<strong>Ted</strong>

Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle. (In 2009...) After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast...  No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn.

7,2,"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.",32,Ted
